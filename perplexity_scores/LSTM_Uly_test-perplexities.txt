Stephen filled again the three cups .    389.8829
Time I used to try <UNK> down on my <UNK> what she said dressing .    786.6116
Their likes : their breaths , too , sweetened with tea and <UNK> , their <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> .    508.6385

That was in his eyes .    28.3614
The <UNK> shavingbowl <UNK> , forgotten , on the parapet .    629.4078
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again , murmuring here and there a word .    271.4524
Tell about places you have been , strange <UNK> .    890.3091
Talbot <UNK> : Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves , Through the dear might . . .    829.8828

Do you want the blind up ?    103.3358
<UNK> with money and <UNK> .    302.7715
Mulligan said , glancing at her .    31.3370
He would be eleven now if he had lived .    366.8456
Useless : can ’ t move .    88.5657

He had reached the open backdoor of All <UNK> .    1008.5831
Where is his <UNK> ?    359.6955
Not at all , Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk .    125.3628

He <UNK> his mouth with fry and <UNK> and <UNK> .    516.8892
His eyes open <UNK> in <UNK> stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted .    872.1445
There ’ s a word I wanted to ask you .    59.2678
Do you know what ?    24.0177
he asked .    3.7211
<UNK> <UNK> a fair trial .    930.4351
Another slice of bread and butter : three , four : right .    205.5620
Their eyes grew <UNK> as the lines were <UNK> .    2941.8167

Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money .    416.4828
Tell her : more and more : all .    138.5940
He curled them between his <UNK> at <UNK> and swallowed them softly .    857.6718
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly : Is this the day for your <UNK> wash , Kinch ?    355.5218
He <UNK> the page with a sheet of <UNK> <UNK> and carried his copybook back to his bench .    373.5676

And do you know why ?    115.4033
There can be no two <UNK> on the matter .    297.3590

He <UNK> , <UNK> , stalked round it , brother , <UNK> <UNK> , went round it , <UNK> <UNK> like a dog all over the dead dog ’ s <UNK> fell .    509.9030
The priest went along by them , murmuring , holding the thing in his hands .    120.0244
He passed Saint Joseph ’ s <UNK> school .    1756.4697
He looked at the cattle , blurred in silver heat .    241.9858

The carcass lay on his path .    105.6515

He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh .    467.0290
Then he read the letter again : twice .    101.1230
<UNK> of <UNK> then and now .    309.2743
Sad too .    41.3158

But to think of your mother <UNK> you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her .    261.3954
He <UNK> swiftly at Stephen ’ s ashplant in <UNK> and , running forward to a brow of the cliff , <UNK> his hands at his sides like <UNK> or wings of one about to rise in the air , and <UNK> : Goodbye , now , goodbye !    250.4809
Comyn asked .    14.8644

Lord , they are weary ; and , whispered to , they sigh .    352.5515
Creation from nothing .    152.8905
He walked on .    39.3511
Still their <UNK> can be very <UNK> .    954.6423
He <UNK> it through his fingers <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> .    701.5153

To smell the gentle smoke of tea , <UNK> of the pan , sizzling butter .    235.6246

A <UNK> rather , Stephen said .    158.1501

By them , the man with my voice and my eyes and a <UNK> with ashes on her breath .    135.2036
From farther away , walking <UNK> across from the <UNK> tide , figures , two .    837.1042

<UNK> of all things I am here to read , <UNK> and <UNK> , the nearing tide , that <UNK> <UNK> .    583.7996
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband .    334.9164
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting .    201.1758
He strolled out to the doorway .    45.1518
The porter <UNK> the valise up on the well .    825.6644
<UNK> : and that is the ineluctable modality of the <UNK> .    134.4229

Behind her lord , his helpmate , <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> .    1185.5537
I put a mark in it .    90.5535
I am , ma ’ am , Buck Mulligan answered .    23.2374
<UNK> back and pointing , Stephen said with <UNK> : It is a symbol of Irish art .    245.4518
That so ?    369.2758
The tea was drawn .    4461.0317
Please tell me what you think of poor me .    148.9827
A <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> with shiny topboots .    3180.4238
<UNK> .    16.7226
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of <UNK> .    535.6930
<UNK> I going to aunt Sara ’ s or not ?    182.6681
Well , <UNK> .    201.4966

In the darkness of the <UNK> they wait , their <UNK> <UNK> , my <UNK> valise , around a board of <UNK> <UNK> .    745.1304
No use <UNK> her .    682.9913
Might work a press pass .    297.9868
Down , up , forward , back .    77.4178
I am trying to work up <UNK> with the <UNK> .    341.9825
Conmee : <UNK> <UNK> knows him : <UNK> .    1745.9624
My <UNK> , Blackwood <UNK> , <UNK> to me it is <UNK> treated and <UNK> in Austria by <UNK> there .    2194.3845
In a Greek <UNK> he breathed his last : <UNK> .    763.6490
Turn back .    56.5533
<UNK> people , proud that their <UNK> son was in the <UNK> .    854.0380
He went in , bowing his head under the low <UNK> .    265.5906
That ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you .    106.0362
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot , a squashed <UNK> <UNK> .    582.0882
<UNK> always for a word of help his hand moved <UNK> the <UNK> symbols , a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> behind his dull skin .    955.3814
Mr Deasy halted , breathing hard and <UNK> his breath .    438.9298
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is <UNK> it .    390.4982
<UNK> friend , a brother soul : Wilde ’ s love that dare not speak its name .    572.2522
For Haines ’ s <UNK> .    167.3927

<UNK> , <UNK> of all <UNK> <UNK> to man .    1115.3430
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower , his razor and mirror <UNK> in the pocket where he had <UNK> them .    175.3235
<UNK> ?    87.4961
Are you a <UNK> student , sir ?    160.9134
Something like those <UNK> : it ’ s that <UNK> of bread : <UNK> <UNK> .    766.9640
And a third , Stephen said , there is who wants me for odd <UNK> .    250.9382
I want to know .    50.4791
He made money .    409.6594
Getting up in a <UNK> .    97.0902
I moved among them on the frozen <UNK> , that I , a <UNK> , among the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .    705.6506
Sure he ’ s not down in <UNK> terrace with his aunt <UNK> ?    594.9979

And you <UNK> .    367.2764
The dog ’ s bark ran towards him , <UNK> , ran back .    220.6797
Buck Mulligan asked .    5.3284
<UNK> Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the <UNK> .    591.5551
First , our little <UNK> <UNK> , he said .    246.8232
My <UNK> , after me , calling , <UNK> !    511.5178
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs . Will send when <UNK> .    1461.7913

Ah , to be sure !    298.9388
<UNK> <UNK> .    1510.9030
That on his empire , Stephen said , the sun never <UNK> .    197.1942
Heigho !    12.3165
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the <UNK> .    479.1870
O yes , W . Remember your <UNK> written on green oval leaves , deeply deep , copies to be sent if you died to all the great <UNK> of the world , <UNK> <UNK> ?    1124.7888
He <UNK> the <UNK> of my art as I fear that of his .    494.1216
But he must send me La <UNK> de J <UNK> by M . L o <UNK> .    2738.6575
She never let them in , he cried again through his laughter as he <UNK> on <UNK> feet over the gravel of the path .    202.8335
Cranly ’ s arm .    8.8677
From me , Kinch , he said .    12.3372

Can pay ten down and the <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> .    1483.5903
He smiled , pouring .    173.8109
Just say in the most <UNK> tone : when I was in Paris ; <UNK> ’ <UNK> ’ , I used to .    595.9497
It <UNK> me too .    570.9630
<UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> , <UNK> her both <UNK> .    3327.2405
Still his <UNK> takes the harm out of it somehow , doesn ’ t it ?    197.7459
Couldn ’ t ask him at a funeral , though .    87.2849
I ’ d like to go but I <UNK> ’ t be able , you see .    147.6187
Open it .    27.9024
The <UNK> jesuit !    5015.2085
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly .    152.9458
<UNK> by the edge of the <UNK> he <UNK> , <UNK> , smelt a rock and from under a <UNK> hindleg pissed against it .    479.0269
<UNK> too far last time .    427.5936
You pay eighty <UNK> and they <UNK> a <UNK> of land for you with olives , <UNK> , <UNK> or <UNK> .    1589.5304

All dimpled cheeks and <UNK> , Your head it simply <UNK> .    2801.6411
The <UNK> of God on you !    438.1501
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said : What ?    130.5493
I will tell you , he said <UNK> , what is his proudest <UNK> .    203.1152
She liked <UNK> .    583.4857

Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> .    205.1648
You are your own master , it seems to me .    184.8111
