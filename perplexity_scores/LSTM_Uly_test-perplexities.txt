That was in his eyes .    117.6659
The <UNK> shavingbowl <UNK> , forgotten , on the parapet .    534.2754
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again , murmuring here and there a word .    412.1416
Tell about places you have been , strange <UNK> .    788.2156
Talbot <UNK> : Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves , Through the dear might . . .    506.5927

He would be eleven now if he had lived .    744.0993
Useless : can ’ t move .    244.0996

He had reached the open backdoor of All <UNK> .    1230.1079

His eyes open <UNK> in <UNK> stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted .    1190.8081
There ’ s a word I wanted to ask you .    234.0173
Do you know what ?    329.2654

Another slice of bread and butter : three , four : right .    362.3596

Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money .    742.0945
Tell her : more and more : all .    192.8939
He curled them between his <UNK> at <UNK> and swallowed them softly .    1309.2096
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly : Is this the day for your <UNK> wash , Kinch ?    709.2385

He <UNK> , <UNK> , stalked round it , brother , <UNK> <UNK> , went round it , <UNK> <UNK> like a dog all over the dead dog ’ s <UNK> fell .    710.0130
The priest went along by them , murmuring , holding the thing in his hands .    334.4753
He passed Saint Joseph ’ s <UNK> school .    1197.4879
He looked at the cattle , blurred in silver heat .    522.1790

Then he read the letter again : twice .    280.6610
<UNK> of <UNK> then and now .    282.3612

To smell the gentle smoke of tea , <UNK> of the pan , sizzling butter .    514.6995

By them , the man with my voice and my eyes and a <UNK> with ashes on her breath .    292.7990
From farther away , walking <UNK> across from the <UNK> tide , figures , two .    714.3561

<UNK> of all things I am here to read , <UNK> and <UNK> , the nearing tide , that <UNK> <UNK> .    613.2614
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband .    929.4312
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting .    368.2040
He strolled out to the doorway .    220.9824
The porter <UNK> the valise up on the well .    516.2327

Behind her lord , his helpmate , <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> .    864.8743
I put a mark in it .    217.7473
I am , ma ’ am , Buck Mulligan answered .    223.7602
<UNK> back and pointing , Stephen said with <UNK> : It is a symbol of Irish art .    481.0176
That so ?    366.9322
The tea was drawn .    472.6534
Please tell me what you think of poor me .    315.9957
A <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> with shiny topboots .    2111.0850
<UNK> .    60.5960
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of <UNK> .    870.5889
<UNK> I going to aunt Sara ’ s or not ?    402.1893
Well , <UNK> .    250.9034

In the darkness of the <UNK> they wait , their <UNK> <UNK> , my <UNK> valise , around a board of <UNK> <UNK> .    1090.9237
No use <UNK> her .    663.7251
Might work a press pass .    568.0981
Down , up , forward , back .    89.9459
I am trying to work up <UNK> with the <UNK> .    704.6113

My <UNK> , Blackwood <UNK> , <UNK> to me it is <UNK> treated and <UNK> in Austria by <UNK> there .    1253.9463
In a Greek <UNK> he breathed his last : <UNK> .    992.3543
Turn back .    109.2488
<UNK> people , proud that their <UNK> son was in the <UNK> .    777.1263
He went in , bowing his head under the low <UNK> .    445.8620
That ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you .    348.4270
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot , a squashed <UNK> <UNK> .    695.8801
<UNK> always for a word of help his hand moved <UNK> the <UNK> symbols , a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> behind his dull skin .    1302.2269
Mr Deasy halted , breathing hard and <UNK> his breath .    783.3768
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is <UNK> it .    535.9597
<UNK> friend , a brother soul : Wilde ’ s love that dare not speak its name .    629.6548
For Haines ’ s <UNK> .    288.6525

<UNK> , <UNK> of all <UNK> <UNK> to man .    712.8402
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower , his razor and mirror <UNK> in the pocket where he had <UNK> them .    426.3947
<UNK> ?    191.7218
Are you a <UNK> student , sir ?    413.8447
Something like those <UNK> : it ’ s that <UNK> of bread : <UNK> <UNK> .    719.3254
And a third , Stephen said , there is who wants me for odd <UNK> .    517.2958
I want to know .    206.3291
He made money .    324.6281
Getting up in a <UNK> .    219.8120
I moved among them on the frozen <UNK> , that I , a <UNK> , among the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .    700.8389

And you <UNK> .    354.3403
The dog ’ s bark ran towards him , <UNK> , ran back .    510.0623
Buck Mulligan asked .    134.8316
<UNK> Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the <UNK> .    654.5320
First , our little <UNK> <UNK> , he said .    468.2112

Ah , to be sure !    369.5295

That on his empire , Stephen said , the sun never <UNK> .    269.9394
Heigho !    145.4962
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the <UNK> .    1027.1005
O yes , W . Remember your <UNK> written on green oval leaves , deeply deep , copies to be sent if you died to all the great <UNK> of the world , <UNK> <UNK> ?    1016.3379
He <UNK> the <UNK> of my art as I fear that of his .    405.5189
But he must send me La <UNK> de J <UNK> by M . L o <UNK> .    2069.3064
She never let them in , he cried again through his laughter as he <UNK> on <UNK> feet over the gravel of the path .    534.6939
Cranly ’ s arm .    120.6521
From me , Kinch , he said .    88.7176

Can pay ten down and the <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> .    1030.7261
He smiled , pouring .    250.2988
Just say in the most <UNK> tone : when I was in Paris ; <UNK> ’ <UNK> ’ , I used to .    650.6237
It <UNK> me too .    460.0068
<UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> , <UNK> her both <UNK> .    1582.8035
Still his <UNK> takes the harm out of it somehow , doesn ’ t it ?    497.2328
Couldn ’ t ask him at a funeral , though .    276.3660
I ’ d like to go but I <UNK> ’ t be able , you see .    452.3038
Open it .    51.2649
The <UNK> jesuit !    2924.2043
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly .    565.2531
<UNK> by the edge of the <UNK> he <UNK> , <UNK> , smelt a rock and from under a <UNK> hindleg pissed against it .    638.4254

All dimpled cheeks and <UNK> , Your head it simply <UNK> .    1616.4907
The <UNK> of God on you !    476.4584
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said : What ?    483.4790
I will tell you , he said <UNK> , what is his proudest <UNK> .    395.6422
She liked <UNK> .    1154.3607
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps .    703.7014

Yes , of course , he said , as they went on again .    149.1674
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with <UNK> <UNK> eyes .    900.3920
There ’ s nothing wrong with him <UNK> at night .    539.5146
You and me , don ’ t you know : in the same boat .    212.5371
