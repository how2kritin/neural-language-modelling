Ah , poor dogsbody !    19.2976
You were making tea , Stephen said , and went across the landing to get more hot water .    40.8081
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face .    97.2754
Come .    2.7733

Where do you begin in this ?    91.6104
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called : Poldy !    100.6832
Where ’ s the sugar ?    48.9235
he said in answer .    44.4795
No - one .    23.4853
After he woke me last night same dream or was it ?    220.7867
Yes , yes , Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh .    33.2518

I ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows .    49.1156
Then a sigh : silence .    94.6833

He folded it under his armpit , went to the door and opened it .    33.2850
Stephen listened in scornful silence .    160.9227
Ah , see now !    59.4435
I am among them , among their battling bodies in a medley , the joust of life .    60.6211

They wash and tub and scrub .    63.1938
Put a pin in that chap , will you ?    37.1390
O , jay , there ’ s no milk .    45.3466
He shaved warily over his chin .    65.5091
Hence those snores .    148.0687
Fed and feeding brains about me : under glowlamps , impaled , with faintly beating feelers : and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld , reluctant , shy of brightness , shifting her dragon scaly folds .    114.1054
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket .    192.2386

Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells .    157.6167
Why should I bring it down ?    195.0275
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm .    119.9671
You were a student , weren ’ t you ?    21.7855
There he is , sure enough , my bold Larry , leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket .    145.2979
Reclaim the whole place .    55.7562
Stephen Dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck .    85.9430
Rather warm .    206.1862
Ay .    2.6855
The sun is there , the slender trees , the lemon houses .    99.1446
What , sir ?    13.5113
Night hours then : black with daggers and eyemasks .    187.2693
Books you were going to write with letters for titles .    79.9508
Feels locked out of it .    41.0858
Glad to hear that , old man .    37.8884
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat , took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband .    57.4229

All soil like that without dung .    164.9984
It has waited so long , Stephen said listlessly , it can wait longer .    181.3742
That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good .    111.4855
I am quiet here alone .    184.0199
Three times a day , after meals , Stephen said drily .    55.9646
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality .    58.7282
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone : Wait till you hear him on Hamlet , Haines .    70.8497
I am , a stride at a time .    30.9248
The dog yelped running to them , reared up and pawed them , dropping on all fours , again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning .    133.0767

But ours is the omphalos .    112.6821
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it .    167.3373
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile , wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace .    122.4350
She was reading the card , propped on her elbow .    74.0401
They don ’ t seem to chew it : only swallow it down .    55.8710
Sit down .    46.0396
She said it would look nice over the bed .    132.4001
The earth .    72.4720
The grub is ready .    107.3504
Her door was open : she wanted to hear my music .    134.4369
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor .    62.3305
You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose .    110.3520
He turned from the tray , lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire .    45.2057
Tranquility sudden , vast , candescent : form of forms .    71.3074
he said kindly .    65.2724
And one shilling threepence change .    294.2915
I pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room , Buck Mulligan said .    26.1638
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth .    182.8024
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now .    75.1587
Metempsychosis , he said , is what the ancient Greeks called it .    38.9764
Later on , Haines said .    17.3542
He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy , filing consents and common searches and a writ of Duces Tecum .    143.4064
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate , patron of arts in the middle ages .    151.5572
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket , reviewing again the soldiers on parade .    124.5700
They are not to be thought away .    96.2590
Listening , he heard her voice : Come , come , pussy .    70.3710
A hoard heaped by the roadside : plundered and passing on .    100.5070
There ’ s nothing smutty in it .    36.8234
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too .    76.3032
Gone too from the world , Averroes and Moses Maimonides , dark men in mien and movement , flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world , a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend .    127.9134
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured .    152.2728
<NUMBER> .    2.0712
There ’ s your snotrag , he said .    9.8050

Bad as a row with Molly .    116.7062
In gay Paree he hides , Egan of Paris , unsought by any save by me .    201.3712
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot .    124.1750
She didn ’ t want anything .    13.6957

Somewhere in the east : early morning : set off at dawn .    74.2789
Look clock .    112.8375
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call , then paused awhile in rapt attention , his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points .    135.4995
Yes , Mr Deasy said .    6.6537
A barren land , bare waste .    207.5101
I shall die !    396.7343
I just wanted to say , he said .    33.4157
Stephen turned away .    70.6657

Poor papa !    49.3757
Too hot to quarrel .    100.5634
No , no , Buck Mulligan shouted in pain .    41.1709
Monkwords , marybeads jabber on their girdles : roguewords , tough nuggets patter in their pockets .    93.9912
You told the Clongowes gentry you had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army .    121.2491

Noon slumbers .    78.5979
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up , saying tritely : Redheaded women buck like goats .    91.9173
He turned to Stephen , saying , as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat : You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints , Kinch , could you ?    46.3603
Lulls all pain .    45.3300
As he and others see me .    108.4266
No .    5.4990

Listen .    1.8095
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him .    174.8432

Patrice , home on furlough , lapped warm milk with me in the bar MacMahon .    100.3352
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles , breathing upward sewage breath , a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man ’ s ashes .    121.9219
Good fallback .    450.7545

Personally I couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal God .    36.5606
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster , her sails brailed up on the crosstrees , homing , upstream , silently moving , a silent ship .    74.1360
Mrs Ellis ’ s .    24.8246
Clean to see : the gloss of her sleek hide , the white button under the butt of her tail , the green flashing eyes .    61.8469
What does she say ?    73.3290
A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace ( descende !    163.2077

Mrs Bandmann Palmer .    254.3787
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires .    141.9565

Did Roberts pay you yet ?    385.3252
Perhaps I am wrong .    48.3713
Full gluey woman ’ s lips .    24.6075
Secrets , silent , stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts : secrets weary of their tyranny : tyrants , willing to be dethroned .    80.9165
That was the rule , said .    44.1233
Son of the wild goose , Kevin Egan of Paris .    70.0138
No - one saw : tell no - one .    82.5734
The aunt thinks you killed your mother , he said .    26.8881
And , spent , its speech ceases .    154.3989
He has the key .    110.6601
Il croit ?    317.1328
Poor man !    94.5095
Sir Lout ’ s toys .    44.1320
As I am .    33.6026
My mother ’ s a jew , my father ’ s a bird .    18.6506
Can ’ t see !    23.5529
He smiled , glancing askance at her mocking eyes .    70.4333
I ’ m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up .    68.9068
Farmhouse , wall round it , blurred cattle cropping .    96.7651
But , I say , Mulligan , you do make strong tea , don ’ t you ?    34.2297
The hens in the next garden : their droppings are very good top dressing .    150.0808
Known as Koch ’ s preparation .    36.9519
Sociable .    2.2007
Where ?    11.8449
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone .    16.1571
Not annoyed then ?    165.8708
Better ask Seymour that .    136.1317
Hello .    1.7782
The mockery of it !    61.1432
Moist pith of farls of bread , the froggreen wormwood , her matin incense , court the air .    49.4159
History , Stephen said , is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake .    40.6976
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente , not doing a hand ’ s turn all day .    106.9844
O how I long to meet you .    99.3157
he asked .    7.6011
No , nothing has happened .    116.0169
Girl ’ s sweet light lips .    40.7862
It must be a movement then , an actuality of the possible as possible .    76.0752
So much the better .    99.7937
Have you the key ?    31.5611
Stephen freed his arm quietly .    93.8362
Yes , sir .    3.3206
He halted .    48.9239
off it and put it neatly into her mouth .    37.7495
O , do , sir .    14.8279
Or a lilt .    26.7131
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right .    37.7315
Look at that now , she said .    18.5757
Bless us , O Lord , and these thy gifts .    177.6482
Citrons too .    20.1471
Then , gazing over the handkerchief , he said : The bard ’ s noserag !    44.8097
What Paddy ?    462.9544
Je ne crois pas en l ’ existence de Dieu .    165.6664
Mulligan , nine pounds , three pairs of socks , one pair brogues , ties .    171.5565
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha .    122.4792
Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt from their pintpots , loudlatinlaughing : Euge !    169.7278
Time enough .    31.4474
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes .    173.1029
But I will fight for the right till the end .    112.3204
Lovely spot it must be : the garden of the world , big lazy leaves to float about on , cactuses , flowery meads , snaky lianas they call them .    108.4565
Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately ?    138.9301
To no end gathered ; vainly then released , forthflowing , wending back : loom of the moon .    179.1114
Put down three and carry five .    165.4684
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock , carefully .    78.9924
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop .    132.5928
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions ?    308.5374
Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee .    128.5401
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells : et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam : the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts , a chemistry of stars .    149.3724
Yes , bread of angels it ’ s called .    80.6929
Open your eyes now .    69.3001
Thanks , old chap , he cried briskly .    53.0275
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa .    239.4968
Go further next time .    264.6793
She tendered a coin , smiling boldly , holding her thick wrist out .    123.2403
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon : Heva , naked Eve .    139.5931
Yes , Mr Bloom said .    7.4517
Can ’ t he hear the difference ?    88.6108
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel .    151.6176
Who ’ s behind me ?    23.7142
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope , ripping it open in jerks .    59.5770
Young student .    243.0277
No great hurry .    232.7982
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript .    118.4324
It does .    124.1981
he said gaily .    76.4304
Comment ?    13.6422
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically .    136.6528
They were about him here and there , with heads still bowed in their crimson halters , waiting for it to melt in their stomachs .    102.8740
Sees me looking .    136.0746
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head , coach after coach .    99.5915
That doctrine of laissez faire which so often in our history .    156.2607
I want puce gloves and green boots .    137.6668
To hell with them all .    68.0064
My missus has just got an .    196.2540
Or leave it there all day , forgotten friendship ?    182.2771
Music hall stage .    169.8734
What perfume does your wife use .    108.3476
In all the highest places : her finance , her press .    83.1912
Still they get their feed all right and their doss .    111.4683
O , rocks !    56.8393
Tiptop , thanks .    20.0205
Hokypoky penny a lump .    198.4655
Makes you feel young .    53.2838
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat .    199.6074
Threepence , please .    32.2148
Ffoo !    15.0070
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly : What is the matter ?    78.0923
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine .    230.2328
O , Milly Bloom , you are my darling .    38.2748
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength .    77.6622
The King ’ s own .    42.5408
Mark my words , Mr Dedalus , he said .    21.4549
And skeweyed Walter sirring his father , no less !    474.7394
The twining stresses , two by two .    137.0289
He stared at them proudly , piled stone mammoth skulls .    277.7075
You could have knelt down , damn it , Kinch , when your dying mother asked you , Buck Mulligan said .    75.1840
Secondleg they should be .    91.0293
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay , his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly .    135.0593
You were going to do wonders , what ?    50.3345
After all , I should think you are able to free yourself .    135.2145
Walter squints vainly for a chair .    107.6500
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs , the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman , a butcher ’ s dame , nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange .    94.9201
O , weeping God , the things I married into !    194.9700
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches .    151.7601
Language no whit worse than his .    331.6548
What about that , eh ?    67.2435
Then , a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking : rumpled , shiny sole .    172.3743
I ’ m coming , Buck Mulligan answered .    14.0053
The air feeds most .    319.9823
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man ’ s stare .    46.1629
No .    5.4990
O , O .    17.4663
Lover , for her love he prowled with colonel Richard Burke , tanist of his sept , under the walls of Clerkenwell and , crouching , saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward in the fog .    86.9054
The other one , jar on her head , was getting the supper : fruit , olives , lovely cool water out of a well , stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown .    104.4317
Shouldering their bags they trudged , the red Egyptians .    134.7031
All .    130.2570
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes .    88.3837
He has washed the upper moiety .    125.5059
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly , shadowing the bay in deeper green .    162.4692
I see little hope , Stephen said , from her or from him .    54.8101
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves .    210.6042
Dringadring !    14.6934
He stood up , gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown , saying resignedly : Mulligan is stripped of his garments .    68.9144
Buck Mulligan asked .    13.1101
Rhythm begins , you see .    55.2039
And he said : Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy !    190.0113
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin , twisted it round in his fingers and cried : A miracle !    82.5424
Moi , je suis socialiste .    217.3723
I have my stick .    63.2537
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish : the last .    129.8001
He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet , laughing to himself .    72.5932
The shiny links , packed with forcemeat , fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs ’ blood .    131.5884
I . . . With him together down . . .    42.7065
No , sir .    4.2635
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa , chap ticking them off in a book , navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees .    105.2574
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor .    53.9806
Pretending to speak broken English as you dragged your valise , porter threepence , across the slimy pier at Newhaven .    185.6486
He threw it on the road .    34.1364
You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street .    190.1272
The crooked skirt swinging , whack by whack by whack .    201.4138
Good morning , sir , Stephen said again , bowing to his bent back .    27.4786
They swarmed loud , uncouth about the temple , their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats .    207.3187
Chucked medicine and going in for the army .    64.1347
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam .    166.3036
No use canvassing him for an ad .    108.4812
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted .    136.9120
Mr Bloom , strolling towards Brunswick street , smiled .    124.3651
We ’ ll be choked , Buck Mulligan said .    19.4598
Maud Gonne ’ s letter about taking them off O ’ Connell street at night : disgrace to our Irish capital .    170.8292
About a million barrels all the same .    65.2351
To Caesar what is Caesar ’ s , to God what is God ’ s .    97.6402
Just C . P . M ’ Coy will do .    71.5252
Goes like this .    91.4000
Is it Paddy Dignam ?    274.2486
Naked nymphs : Greece : and for instance all the people that lived then .    144.3163
If anyone thinks that I amn ’ t divine He ’ ll get no free drinks when I ’ m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again .    178.9888
Simple bit of paper .    90.5022
Eleven , is it ?    12.4852
I know the voice .    155.6201
Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head .    121.8303
He stood suddenly , his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil .    119.8828
Spurned and undespairing .    38.6781
Yet here ’ s a spot .    22.6903
Give us that key , Kinch , Buck Mulligan said , to keep my chemise flat .    70.1982
Meade ’ s timberyard .    9.4934
Dying , he said again , if not dead by now .    40.6570
Why ?    18.1959
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree , for instance .    140.2336
My missus has just got an engagement .    171.7747
Doesn ’ t see me .    8.8928
A thing out in the water .    39.0656
Square it you with the boss and we ’ ll split the job , see ?    72.8872
What ’ s left us then ?    87.4608
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers , leaned upon his spear .    130.2345
Like me , like Algy , coming down to our mighty mother .    99.8190
In a moment they will laugh more loudly , aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay .    128.0952
And past Nichols ’ the undertaker .    241.1439
Influence of the climate .    22.4224
Watering cart .    173.6076
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner , nursing his hat and newspaper .    114.0163
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers .    109.6494
Buck Mulligan said .    2.6375
He ’ s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks , is he ?    104.4730
Why , sir ?    8.8439
I don ’ t mince words , do I ?    35.5946
All I can give you I give .    117.2523
Her head dancing .    123.8442
Down , sir !    12.4543
Poor old professor Goodwin .    157.3912
Haines sat down on a stone , smoking .    24.7541
Wombed in sin darkness I was too , made not begotten .    102.8138
So warm .    367.9165
Darkness is in our souls do you not think ?    87.9079
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker .    56.0971
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight ?    44.4597
Drink water scented with fennel , sherbet .    127.5932
And when I makes water I makes water .    162.5320
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch .    162.6878
Silly Milly ’ s birthday gift .    75.9521
The only true thing in life ?    279.4412
She serves me at his beck .    87.4116
Where ?    11.8449
If I fell over a cliff that beetles o ’ er his base , fell through the nebeneinander ineluctably !    153.8915
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees , hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield .    57.3155
I see you ’ re . . . O , no , Mr Bloom said .    14.4939
Why , I wonder .    37.6237
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand , a rag of wolf ’ s tongue redpanting from his jaws .    65.5526
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair .    109.0840
I ’ m coming , Stephen said , turning .    11.6411
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth , hiding and revealing its yellow glow .    94.6075
Six weeks off , however .    123.4066
Yes , sir .    3.3206
Just loll there : quiet dusk : let everything rip .    251.6063
A bit at a time .    36.0671
Ay !    24.9407
Ceasing , he began to shave with care .    54.3630
Not this Monsieur , I said .    25.6439
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets .    160.1146
You know , Dedalus , you have the real Oxford manner .    91.5104
Cough it up .    21.9044
He put the huge key in his inner pocket .    118.6827
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’ s face .    55.0396
Then the next one .    35.4915
He ’ s English , Buck Mulligan said , and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland .    51.4345
It ’ s about the foot and mouth disease .    47.8473
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here .    189.3642
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day .    66.4663
Well : slainte !    70.6399
I will see if I can see .    52.8726
Your postprandial , do you know that word ?    53.9326
Here .    3.0617
She raised a gloved hand to her hair .    76.4601
A merchant , Stephen said , is one who buys cheap and sells dear , jew or gentile , is he not ?    74.7135
Haines , who had been laughing guardedly , walked on beside Stephen and said : We oughtn ’ t to laugh , I suppose .    81.8780
He has nowhere to put it , you mug .    66.1336
He threw it .    34.5346
Other stocking .    83.3061
To come to the point at issue .    75.9885
Red carpet spread .    122.0365
Old style .    113.7108
But one day you must feel it .    84.7599
No , sir .    4.2635
There again : the overtone following through the air .    80.9135
Three times now .    71.3109
He held the page aslant patiently , bending his senses and his will , his soft subject gaze at rest .    117.3293
On earth as it is in heaven .    121.6469
Here , she said .    6.2110
He stooped and gathered them .    58.6893
Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again , he said , and show them to you , sir .    38.0589
A quart , Stephen said .    17.1722
The way of all our old industries .    196.9084
Very well then , I contradict myself .    113.4842
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail .    65.2843
Cocklepickers .    2.1525
He thinks you ’ re not a gentleman .    44.2995
My father gave me seeds to sow .    206.9788
You pique my curiosity , Haines said amiably .    60.9923
Pert little piece she was .    124.5289
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard , their land a pawnshop .    200.5366
I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms , who left the house of his father and left the God of his father .    59.1529
Dead : an old woman ’ s : the grey sunken cunt of the world .    29.2918
He turned over the smudged pages .    61.8910
What time ?    111.4484
Lascivious people .    221.2950
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars : priest with a scroll rolled up .    80.2283
And he said : Another victory like that and we are done for .    80.8998
He turned back quickly , coughing , laughing , his lifted arms waving to the air .    84.5170
This dogsbody to rid of vermin .    130.6735
A pier , sir , Armstrong said .    12.7473
I suppose I did say it .    105.7078
After a silence Cochrane said : What is it , sir ?    53.1202
Click does the trick .    112.7384
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by , amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss .    171.4859
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall .    110.9125
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble , fanshoals of fishes , silly shells .    89.4090
By a woman who was no better than she should be .    64.9002
No wind could lift those waves , grey metal , poisonous foggy waters .    162.8180
At Plevna that was .    139.1082
Was given milk too long .    313.6983
Pointed cuffs .    60.6955
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh .    231.8714
They followed the winding path down to the creek .    86.4065
With it an abode of bliss .    98.8431
Try it anyhow .    38.7808
he asked , turning .    22.7420
God , isn ’ t he dreadful ?    42.2080
Where are you off to ?    50.8708
God , these bloody English !    169.3852
And , faith , he filled up .    59.7970
Behind .    2.9613
Waters : bitter death : lost .    91.9962
Pleasant evenings we had then .    277.5178
Jousts , slush and uproar of battles , the frozen deathspew of the slain , a shout of spearspikes baited with men ’ s bloodied guts .    62.7249
Scutter !    15.1090
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats , the gently champing teeth .    89.0412
No ?    61.5530
The oval equine faces , Temple , Buck Mulligan , Foxy Campbell , Lanternjaws .    65.6861
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly , more , till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold , a limp lid .    194.2721
She poured again a measureful and a tilly .    70.8037
I just simply stood pale , silent , bayed about .    268.7891
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text : Weep no more , woful shepherds , weep no more For Lycidas , your sorrow , is not dead , Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor . . .    99.0554
Spurned lover .    214.0152

Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket .    42.2329
She listens with big dark soft eyes .    174.1430

He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea , tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in .    87.2681
He creased out the letter at his side , reading it slowly as he chewed , sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth .    49.3652

So here ’ s to disciples and Calvary .    52.4209
You can almost taste it , can ’ t you ?    54.6521
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce .    114.7546
Thanks , Stephen said .    3.8862
I often think of the beautiful name you have .    70.0239
I ’ m parched .    15.2452

Photo girl he calls her .    69.0244
Pardoned a classical allusion .    39.1295
Hurry .    2.3935
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet .    24.0215
It lay beneath him , a bowl of bitter waters .    71.3001
It ’ s nine days today .    42.4773
What ?    22.7840
Full fathom five thy father lies .    215.7284
The Bruce ’ s brother , Thomas Fitzgerald , silken knight , Perkin Warbeck , York ’ s false scion , in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory , wonder of a day , and Lambert Simnel , with a tail of nans and sutlers , a scullion crowned    64.0164
.    N/A
Ah yes !    1046.2679
Our swim first , Buck Mulligan said .    33.6161
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air : mouth to her moomb .    176.1421
She thought you wanted a cheese hollandais .    132.2659
Lethargy .    2.1300
Houyhnhnm , horsenostrilled .    30.9709
I blow him out about you , Buck Mulligan said , and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes .    79.1366
The boy ’ s blank face asked the blank window .    94.9005
Vico Road , Dalkey .    78.3758
Famine , plague and slaughters .    33.3278
Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade .    41.8603
No use humming then .    205.5772
Tell me now , Stephen said , poking the boy ’ s shoulder with the book , what is a pier .    31.7341
A mouthful of tea .    29.4255
Allimportant question .    118.7594
He has nothing to sit down on , sir .    43.1719
That ’ s why she won ’ t .    18.2589
Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme .    150.4968
Why are their tongues so rough ?    267.1173
He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea .    78.8388
Thus spake Zarathustra .    134.3380
No .    5.4990
Why don ’ t you trust me more ?    28.5451
His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand , a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck .    125.6062
No - one .    23.4853
They do .    98.9284
I don ’ t see anything .    10.3366
Young kisses : the first .    40.3756
That reminds me , Haines said , rising , that I have to visit your national library today .    68.4723
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes .    84.2404
Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s Ginger Ale ( Aromatic ) .    183.5675
Halted , he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely : Come up , Kinch !    86.8729
Heigho !    7.6108
Can become ideal winter sanatorium .    203.3382
Ghostly light on the tortured face .    70.4602
A wild piece of goods .    110.6357
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning .    34.7539
Glorious , pious and immortal memory .    62.9949
Sounds solid : made by the mallet of Los Demiurgos .    87.3687
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month ?    118.8982
Again : a goal .    32.2990
Nice to hold , cool waxen fruit , hold in the hand , lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume .    76.5520
There ’ s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found .    101.6514
Yes , I am here now .    20.5867
How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that .    111.4069
My childhood bends beside me .    149.2389

If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane .    108.9145
She , she , she .    135.2229
I ’ m stony .    33.9330
Someone killed her , Stephen said gloomily .    68.5472
O , yes , Mr Bloom said .    7.2330
You ’ re not a believer , are you ?    21.4844
With mother ’ s money order , eight shillings , the banging door of the post office slammed in your face by the usher .    73.4709
Another time .    37.3003
One tabloid of cascara sagrada .    132.9797
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger , teadust , biscuitmush .    77.6020
In the trousers I left off .    81.9295
Wander through awned streets .    168.1751
Virginia creepers .    93.1821
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers ’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles .    64.5858
My handkerchief .    104.4544
the cat said loudly .    124.1144
Give you the needle that would .    84.0888
He died on Monday , poor fellow .    120.5535
Always the same , year after year .    84.4735
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm .    98.5136
Thursday : not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley ’ s .    72.3677
Justice .    2.1408
You were awfully holy , weren ’ t you ?    21.3421
Corpse .    2.1982
Too full for words .    79.4848
Creaky wardrobe .    95.2810
Sands and stones .    37.7457
he said quietly .    30.8505
I hear them at the piano downstairs .    64.4799
The truth , spit it out .    76.5182
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him , moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water .    64.1356
We did great biz yesterday .    221.6156
Yes , what is it ?    12.0301
Per second per second .    113.6075
Kind of stuff you read : in the track of the sun .    36.8868
Might manage a sketch .    178.2013
A phrase , then , of impatience , thud of Blake ’ s wings of excess .    49.9264
I throw this ended shadow from me , manshape ineluctable , call it back .    133.5488
A sweetened boy ’ s breath .    24.1801
We ’ ll owe twopence , he said .    16.4747
Fabled by the daughters of memory .    34.9453
How are you ?    21.8708
Kingstown pier , Stephen said .    7.1053
Stephen , an elbow rested on the jagged granite , leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve .    81.4174
The soul is in a manner all that is : the soul is the form of forms .    73.1628
O , my name for you is the best : Kinch , the knife - blade .    65.7868
But I couldn ’ t go in that light suit .    44.2065
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses .    91.1240
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech , confidently .    118.8256
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws , a lady of letters .    125.2873
Then feel all like one family party , same in the theatre , all in the same swim .    85.3797
Let me be and let me live .    153.4174
Ham and eggs , no .    41.2827
It bore the oldest , the first race .    126.9337
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last : Rather bleak in wintertime , I should say .    119.8215
They like them sizeable .    310.6733
That must be why the women go after them .    115.1678
Proudly walking .    126.1586
Funny I don ’ t remember that .    14.4854
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes .    187.5455
I was young .    127.1939
I would want to .    138.7598
Valise I have a particular fancy for .    80.6778
Well ?    25.1215
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back .    70.1258
They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently , Frauenzimmer : and down the shelving shore flabbily , their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand .    99.6373
he murmured to himself .    68.8971
What did you say that for ?    40.3746
Not like Ecce Homo .    368.6421
Families of them .    13.4628
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone .    176.3090
Warm sunshine merrying over the sea .    78.9005
He leaned back and went on again , having just remembered .    77.3545
Sit down a moment .    34.4806
Some say they remember their past lives .    213.8647
Then he put a forkful into his mouth , chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat .    80.5869
Haines said , beginning to point at Stephen .    34.3493
Cup of tea now .    26.9157
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth , murmuring all the time .    60.2346
Who ’ s getting it up ?    24.7938
Of lost leaders , the betrayed , wild escapes .    120.4548
Turning the curve he waved his hand .    65.2098
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads .    158.7480
They all fall to the ground .    78.1486
Their Eldorado .    63.2509
Barrels bumped in his head : dull porter slopped and churned inside .    86.8530
On the hands down .    31.4065
He passed it along the table towards the old woman , saying : Ask nothing more of me , sweet .    74.0329
Are there any letters for me ?    75.2628
Buck Mulligan , walking forward again , raised his hands .    41.9104
No : that book .    67.0885
Stephen asked .    10.0958
She curtseyed and went out , followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant : Heart of my heart , were it more , More would be laid at your feet .    73.8991
He coasted them , walking warily .    122.0146
The drone of his misleading whistle brings Walter back .    112.4559
Liliata rutilantium .    63.8489
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket .    93.2200
A flower .    123.1007
He liked thick giblet soup , nutty gizzards , a stuffed roast heart , liverslices fried with crustcrumbs , fried hencods ’ roes .    93.3339
There he is .    100.9803
A server of a servant .    38.0989
No guts in it .    55.1475
Beauty is not there .    26.7035
I feel so bad about .    238.0958
The cat went up in soft bounds .    102.0935
He says it ’ s very clever .    70.4905
Usual love scrimmage .    165.4978
Well , I am here now .    20.9136
White breast of the dim sea .    64.4541
So .    11.5979
With the Bannons .    36.5133
Why not endless till the farthest star ?    322.1611
I thirst .    64.1249
Nothing doing .    87.8204
Eyes front .    125.0060
A million pounds , wait a moment .    106.4832
I hope that smallpox up there doesn ’ t get worse .    74.6090
Now that was farseeing .    39.0535
What ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet ’ s breezy . . . Goodbye , now , goodbye !    59.6723
Damn it .    12.9783
The king was in his countinghouse .    46.1588
Only five she was then .    97.6649
Heaviness : hot day coming .    88.5034
He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread , impaled on his knife .    86.6008
Your wife and my wife .    62.4562
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and , glancing at Haines and Stephen , crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone .    87.8236
Who was telling me ?    93.3058
Cheeseparing nose .    71.2112
That is Kevin Egan ’ s movement I made , nodding for his nap , sabbath sleep .    93.7841
The Ship , Buck Mulligan cried .    51.0273
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid ?    166.5189
Dogskull , dogsniff , eyes on the ground , moves to one great goal .    51.2539
Russell , one guinea , Cousins , ten shillings , Bob Reynolds , half a guinea , Koehler , three guineas , Mrs MacKernan , five weeks ’ board .    67.0263
Might be happy all the same that way .    114.5181
They take me for a dun , peer out from a coign of vantage .    61.2401
The new air greeted him , harping in wild nerves , wind of wild air of seeds of brightness .    68.2538
Let him stay , Stephen said .    20.3897
I think of you so often you have no idea .    134.7482
Would you like a bite of something ?    29.4481
The flood is following me .    87.0099
To provoke the rain .    51.0963
Not a bit funky .    69.1074
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers .    303.0031
Of course I ’ m a Britisher , Haines ’ s voice said , and I feel as one .    30.1197
No , she can jump me .    39.9187
<NUMBER> B . C . Asculum , Stephen said , glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book .    33.0954
Spoils slung at her back .    33.0094
By the way no harm .    101.7193
I ’ d go if I possibly could .    88.8361
Softsoaping .    2.1138
Stephen rustled the sheets again .    76.6407
Buss her , wap in rogues ’ rum lingo , for , O , my dimber wapping dell !    97.5508
A kind of a bridge .    25.2353
Hothouse in Botanic gardens .    74.4894
Get down , baldpoll !    123.5979
Done to a turn .    42.2950
I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman .    200.0173
I ’ m the bermensch .    18.2964
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts .    57.4907
Gone .    2.5607
A shout in the street , Stephen answered , shrugging his shoulders .    32.7480
Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea .    64.3342
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand , trotting , sniffing on all sides .    65.7893
What are you singing ?    95.4380
There is no time to lose .    64.5382
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn ’ t live .    80.6097
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head .    107.5646
From whom ?    175.1636
We ’ re always tired in the morning , Stephen said to Haines .    25.0817
It ’ s a law something like that .    20.2893
Coloured on a flat : yes , that ’ s right .    21.7757
M . Fifteen yesterday .    94.7089
Then what is it ?    20.2137
The cat , having cleaned all her fur , returned to the meatstained paper , nosed at it and stalked to the door .    63.7716
Just how she stalks over my writingtable .    123.2093
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone , in shirtsleeves , his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder .    47.3030
Gaze in your omphalos .    49.6506
Some people believe , he said , that we go on living in another body after death , that we lived before .    85.2076
Poor Dignam !    302.8011
Irish Homestead .    86.4160
Papa ’ s little bedpal .    20.2753
Says he found a sweet young thing down there .    81.1169
The froeken , bonne tout faire , who rubs male nakedness in the bath at Upsala .    94.9669
Go on then , Talbot .    60.8298
Pyrrhus , sir ?    4.9118
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and , bending in loose laughter , said to Stephen ’ s ear : O , shade of Kinch the elder !    94.1072
Talk : as if that would mend matters .    130.4762
He walked along the upwardcurving path .    134.6977
Four shining sovereigns , Buck Mulligan cried with delight .    68.8728
Just one moment .    61.2954
Soft day , sir John !    36.2642
Hello , M ’ Coy .    18.0785
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland .    93.3946
Like to see her again in that .    23.3875
More tell me , more still !    124.4351
Would I make any money by it ?    134.7606
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday .    164.7114
Haines stood at the doorway , looking out .    36.8422
That is why mystic monks .    153.9746
Mrs Marion .    28.5746
His arm .    60.9634
Have you read his F ?    87.3741
Buck Mulligan said .    2.6375
Number eighty still unlet .    302.8561
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare ’ s ghost is Hamlet ’ s grandfather .    42.5691
You ’ ll look spiffing in them .    48.3899
Our prize titbit : Matcham ’ s Masterstroke .    50.0489
Must get those settled really .    179.2589
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her .    71.8384
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word ?    74.9411
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow .    101.8804
Haines sat down to pour out the tea .    35.4599
Womb of sin .    26.6289
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows .    65.7582
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem .    55.9551
Watch !    7.5488
No black clouds anywhere , are there ?    196.3557
Say he got ten per cent off .    181.5005
One of the best , M ’ Coy said .    28.6288
Hooray !    14.3827
O ’ Brien .    68.2178
They ’ re taught that .    45.2811
McCann , one guinea .    38.2212
To learn one must be humble .    107.3151
she cried , running to lap .    48.0068
With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table , with trousers down at heels , chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears .    58.8626
Thanks : new tam : Mr Coghlan : lough Owel picnic : young student : Blazes Boylan ’ s seaside girls .    96.1292
The cracked lookingglass of a servant .    25.4477
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak .    133.5155
Her slim legs running up the staircase .    67.9299
Ah , poor dogsbody !    19.2976
God !    32.0920
And a letter for you .    26.5560
You had better get your stick and go out to the others , Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form .    55.6690
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes , rearing horses , rocks .    132.2110
Agendath Netaim : planters ’ company .    125.6859
Weary too in sight of lovers , lascivious men , a naked woman shining in her courts , she draws a toil of waters .    81.9899
At one , he said .    10.0418
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade .    43.5653
Costive .    2.1575
What is your idea of Hamlet ?    80.6548
Arbutus place : Pleasants street : pleasant old times .    194.9251
There ’ s only one sense of the word , it seems to me , Stephen said .    27.9087
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs , nebeneinander .    84.0557
Sleeping sickness in the air .    21.5948
Leaving the door ajar , amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces .    98.0011
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth .    100.6188
Cyril Sargent : his name and seal .    70.0306
It ’ s all right .    7.4184
The figures whitened in his mind , unsolved : displeased , he let them fade .    77.0878
Then he put on his hat again , relieved : and read again : choice blend , made of the finest Ceylon brands .    63.7585
Hair ?    21.1354
Shut your eyes and see .    46.6275

Twopence a pint , fourpence a quart , eightpence a gallon of porter , no , one and fourpence a gallon of porter .    57.6140
Table : able .    40.3589
His head disappeared and reappeared .    85.7752
The Evening Telegraph . . . That will do , Mr Deasy said .    28.9465
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him .    49.1604
Buck Mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight .    27.0293
Damn all else they are good for .    111.0999
Chewer of corpses !    63.6509
she said .    6.5878
Time enough , sir , she said , taking the coin .    20.1918
Fifteen multiplied by .    409.2634
Queer I was just thinking that moment .    77.8280
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord , hushed in ruddy wool .    101.9914
No , the dog .    37.7132
Then he went to the dresser , took the jug Hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him , poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor .    51.4873
Pier with lamps , summer evening , band .    78.9475
My twelfth rib is gone , he cried .    69.6939
Most licentious custom .    120.8214
Then think of the competition .    52.7901
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight , putting back his savingsbox .    103.3987
Keen glance you gave her .    138.0625
You might put down my name at the funeral , will you ?    59.1070
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings , darned with lumpy wool .    162.5236
Why did you enclose the stamps ?    94.0827
Sleep six months out of twelve .    79.9278
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker .    38.7189
Where is my hat , by the way ?    39.7682
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up , roll over to the sun a puffy face , saltwhite .    93.0226
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after .    74.7633
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks , cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket , his hat tilted down on his eyes .    79.5648
Wife is oldish .    42.3323
They will walk on it tonight , coming here in the dark .    54.4395
He carried it upstairs , his thumb hooked in the teapot handle .    103.2930
Then , lo and behold , they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons .    188.7333
Plasters on a sore eye .    41.1459
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly , an elbow on the pillow .    107.5756
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand .    34.3712
Reading , lying back now , counting the strands of her hair , smiling , braiding .    48.7558
Speaking to me .    18.1968
She asked you who was in your room .    58.6806
Cigar has a cooling effect .    82.3661
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly , showing an open copybook .    259.7950
Hello , Bloom .    47.9575
No good eggs with this drouth .    132.5742
Listen .    1.8095
To evening lands .    104.5328
What is that , a bob here and there , dribs and drabs .    63.0109
Who ever anywhere will read these written words ?    405.4684
And Mr ?    188.8793
It ’ s in the lock , Stephen said , coming forward .    24.2086
It sat there , dull and squat , its spout stuck out .    123.4360
Yes , my love ?    35.2441
Or was that only possible which came to pass ?    230.4665
No , they will pass on , passing , chafing against the low rocks , swirling , passing .    87.2201
Call away let him : thy quarrons dainty is .    174.1253
Talbot asked simply , bending forward .    124.9202
See now .    18.8737
I got mummy ’ s lovely box of creams and am writing .    106.1594
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were ?    372.6818
Stephen said .    3.3393
A hard one , sir .    24.0949
Morning mouth bad images .    235.1089
Then come out a bit spreeish .    77.7380
It ’ s not fair to tease you like that , Kinch , is it ?    26.0679
It is very simple , Stephen said as he stood up .    34.0625
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter .    38.8668
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues .    44.2822
Poor papa !    49.3756
Nothing she can eat ?    113.9688
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke .    284.8811
The words troubled their gaze .    254.9701
Everything on it ?    22.7569
he asked .    7.6011
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack .    77.1382
Sir .    2.8714
They are waiting for him now .    50.6469
Now I ’ m going to try publicity .    25.7207
Inishboffin .    2.1293
Excuse bad writing .    81.3394
An example ?    166.9834
He saw their speeds , backing king ’ s colours , and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds .    60.6860
Save it they can ’ t .    32.2875
Give up the moody brooding .    55.3118
Not a word more on that subject !    211.6049
Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou .    1508.6892
No use thinking of it any more .    99.1927
Didn ’ t catch me napping that wheeze .    60.3078
I said .    25.3059
Stephen , shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart , said very coldly : I am not thinking of the offence to my mother .    68.6735
Nom de Dieu !    72.0263
All the way from Gibraltar .    72.9023
In a suddenly changed tone he added : To tell you the God ’ s truth I think you ’ re right .    87.6223
Il est irlandais .    57.8196
Hard as nails at a bargain , old Tweedy .    64.4819
His arm : Cranly ’ s arm .    48.1901
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney .    87.1451
Perhaps he was a woman .    18.5533
Her hat sank at once .    106.2365
One moment .    37.9803
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him .    108.1697
That will do , Mr Deasy said briskly .    33.8273
With envy he watched their faces : Edith , Ethel , Gerty , Lily .    89.4642
Stephen asked her .    33.6554
Buck Mulligan said .    2.6375
He walked on , waiting to be spoken to , trailing his ashplant by his side .    54.9942
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect : Is there any . . . no trouble I hope ?    79.1413
I have a letter here for the press .    33.3110
What they called nymphs , for example .    123.3201
Who knows ?    103.4556
Soft mark .    70.4341
Where is she ?    25.0334
Japhet in search of a father !    60.8601
He shook his constraint from him nervously .    102.1566
I remember .    75.0823
Yes .    5.0748
You wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you .    66.1786

Vain : very .    91.9751

She gazed straight before her , inhaling through her arched nostrils .    252.2678
To the secretary of state for war , Stephen added over his shoulder .    72.8233
He ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman .    42.2476
Cleanchested .    2.1312
Rum idea : eating bits of a corpse .    75.5824
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim , rinsing empties and old man in the cellar .    75.8082
O let him !    534.4563
Bold hand .    18.2469
I get paid this morning , Stephen said .    39.2019
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen .    85.1825
He halted before Dlugacz ’ s window , staring at the hanks of sausages , polonies , black and white .    55.8151
And to think of your having to beg from these swine .    163.3072
You have two copies there .    105.8457
It wouldn ’ t pan out somehow .    61.4806
Bath a most private thing .    98.6471
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry : Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one , and Arius , warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father , and Valentine , spurning Christ ’ s terrene body , and    76.4583
the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son .    415.6650
Ringsend : wigwams of brown steersmen and master mariners .    86.2323

You , Cochrane , what city sent for him ?    159.7808
Ruins and tenements .    51.9872
He scrambled up by the stones , water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair , water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth .    73.1461
The coals were reddening .    135.6351
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine .    156.3860
I forget the place , sir .    39.1411
Did I not take it up ?    66.9918
My wife too , he said .    13.0247
Ferm .    2.1367

A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him .    113.6147
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high .    59.7806
Looked shut .    78.8260
Why Ophelia committed suicide .    1157.3976
Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him , cleft by a crooked crack .    63.6911
What then ?    155.8715
Airs romped round him , nipping and eager airs .    90.0172

He smiled , pleasing himself .    94.9044
Mulligan said .    4.5849
Stephen , taking his ashplant from its leaningplace , followed them out and , as they went down the ladder , pulled to the slow iron door and locked it .    60.8702
For whom ?    146.0442
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur ’ s yelping .    51.8322
They are coming , waves .    71.4576
No more letters , I hope .    106.4435
He can ’ t make you out .    75.0131
I ’ ll do that , Mr Bloom said , moving to get off .    24.6977
From the liberties , out for the day .    30.1461
Electric .    2.1311
He frowned sternly on the bright air .    62.2113
Go easy .    99.3457

No , I didn ’ t .    11.4788
I am caught in this burning scene .    188.1981
For you , please ?    48.5530
