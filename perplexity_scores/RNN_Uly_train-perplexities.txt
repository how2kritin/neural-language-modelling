Irish , Buck Mulligan said .    128.7950
Ah , poor dogsbody !    433.9997
You were making tea , Stephen said , and went across the landing to get more hot water .    454.2855
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face .    811.2517
Come .    27.4625

He glanced round him .    787.1343
Letter .    27.4251
Where do you begin in this ?    695.4688
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called : Poldy !    799.3632
Where ’ s the sugar ?    113.2864
he said in answer .    171.5318
No - one .    296.5830
After he woke me last night same dream or was it ?    1120.5319
Yes , yes , Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh .    356.4080
In Rodot ’ s Yvonne and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties , shattering with gold teeth chaussons of pastry , their mouths yellowed with the pus of flan br ton .    911.0563
Then , catching sight of Stephen Dedalus , he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air , gurgling in his throat and shaking his head .    485.1045
Know that old lay ?    769.3140
I ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows .    405.1287
Then a sigh : silence .    296.9966

He folded it under his armpit , went to the door and opened it .    316.7947
Stephen listened in scornful silence .    691.1614
Ah , see now !    255.4064
I am among them , among their battling bodies in a medley , the joust of life .    475.3995

Loveless , landless , wifeless .    138.5056
I am getting on nicely in the dark .    321.7002
Will happen , yes .    248.7426
A sleepy soft grunt answered : Mn .    1153.7603
Thanks , Sargent answered .    183.0770
He turned the pages back .    276.7929

A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up .    424.2450
Stately , plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead , bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed .    479.6863

They wash and tub and scrub .    504.1175
Put a pin in that chap , will you ?    416.7808
O , jay , there ’ s no milk .    166.9335
He shaved warily over his chin .    646.5137
Hence those snores .    412.2173
Fed and feeding brains about me : under glowlamps , impaled , with faintly beating feelers : and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld , reluctant , shy of brightness , shifting her dragon scaly folds .    640.0706
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket .    1082.7009
Rank heresy for them .    530.6295

By Brady ’ s cottages a boy for the skins lolled , his bucket of offal linked , smoking a chewed fagbutt .    528.9120
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea .    1821.1294
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells .    944.8733
Why should I bring it down ?    739.3082
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm .    972.3881
You were a student , weren ’ t you ?    340.1292
There he is , sure enough , my bold Larry , leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket .    732.6903
Reclaim the whole place .    450.7740
Stephen Dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck .    507.9548
Rather warm .    200.6843
Ay .    27.4790
The sun is there , the slender trees , the lemon houses .    338.7203
What , sir ?    114.5386
Night hours then : black with daggers and eyemasks .    715.2774
Books you were going to write with letters for titles .    650.0916
Feels locked out of it .    228.6573
Glad to hear that , old man .    281.2991
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat , took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband .    495.6071
Blotchy brown brick houses .    1090.0668
Explain that : morning hours , noon , then evening coming on , then night hours .    515.4198
A crazy queen , old and jealous .    524.2207
All soil like that without dung .    859.1765
It has waited so long , Stephen said listlessly , it can wait longer .    647.1852
That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good .    665.9617
I am quiet here alone .    773.4941
Three times a day , after meals , Stephen said drily .    342.4968
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality .    365.2031
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone : Wait till you hear him on Hamlet , Haines .    448.6139
I am , a stride at a time .    222.4835
The dog yelped running to them , reared up and pawed them , dropping on all fours , again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning .    912.9319
Who chose this face for me ?    1166.3367
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread .    428.5848
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub .    1690.3568
He slunk back in a curve .    379.5131
I pass .    257.3699
After , Stephen said .    57.5025
Easy now .    118.3621
We must go to Athens .    519.0557
But ours is the omphalos .    241.2834
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it .    864.3524
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile , wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace .    881.6764
She was reading the card , propped on her elbow .    399.9394
They don ’ t seem to chew it : only swallow it down .    432.6775
Sit down .    152.4021
She said it would look nice over the bed .    451.1243
The earth .    220.8163
The grub is ready .    732.4094
Her door was open : she wanted to hear my music .    682.8454
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor .    452.9759
You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose .    656.5376
He turned from the tray , lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire .    382.6960
Tranquility sudden , vast , candescent : form of forms .    401.3162
he said kindly .    222.8353
And one shilling threepence change .    1095.4530
I pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room , Buck Mulligan said .    258.0032
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth .    1193.7815
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now .    621.6498
Metempsychosis , he said , is what the ancient Greeks called it .    252.8998
Later on , Haines said .    133.7990
He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy , filing consents and common searches and a writ of Duces Tecum .    963.8535
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate , patron of arts in the middle ages .    1004.2372
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket , reviewing again the soldiers on parade .    640.2198
They are not to be thought away .    455.3012
Listening , he heard her voice : Come , come , pussy .    292.3220
A hoard heaped by the roadside : plundered and passing on .    651.6247
There ’ s nothing smutty in it .    149.5382
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too .    421.8765
Gone too from the world , Averroes and Moses Maimonides , dark men in mien and movement , flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world , a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend .    639.6171
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured .    588.4042
<NUMBER> .    27.4153
There ’ s your snotrag , he said .    84.2251
Household slops .    198.6345
Yet someone had loved him , borne him in her arms and in her heart .    522.7470
Then the next one : a small old woman .    425.7207
O , that ’ s all only all right .    169.3619
New blood .    262.9508
I taught him to sing The boys of Kilkenny are stout roaring blades .    1441.1624
Give hands , traverse , bow to partner : so : imps of fancy of the Moors .    414.8549
Knows the taste of them now .    217.8461
A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him , listlessly holding her battered caskhoop .    1264.5979
Half day , sir .    147.3774
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament .    692.4437
And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek .    688.4327
Miaow !    227.1378
Heigho !    225.4775
Bad as a row with Molly .    450.1438
In gay Paree he hides , Egan of Paris , unsought by any save by me .    836.3114
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot .    889.2344
She didn ’ t want anything .    265.7792
The quick touch .    423.4323
That ’ s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter .    406.0020
Dirty cleans .    217.9814
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction .    1126.7180
Somewhere in the east : early morning : set off at dawn .    598.3290
Look clock .    306.6306
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call , then paused awhile in rapt attention , his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points .    974.5605
Yes , Mr Deasy said .    166.0354
A barren land , bare waste .    951.6962
I shall die !    1816.7365
I just wanted to say , he said .    255.3750
Stephen turned away .    328.5275
My tablets .    322.6058
Ask me , sir , Comyn said .    144.8301
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet .    1019.8483
His hand groped vainly in his pockets .    533.4727
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself .    446.4027
Skin breeds lice or vermin .    881.2662
Poor papa !    1077.0913
Too hot to quarrel .    394.1792
No , no , Buck Mulligan shouted in pain .    279.9650
Monkwords , marybeads jabber on their girdles : roguewords , tough nuggets patter in their pockets .    778.2781
You told the Clongowes gentry you had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army .    644.8772
Silence , all .    47.9636
The sum was done .    727.0013
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush , faded , the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles : world without end .    714.6638
I know , I know .    176.6974
One moment .    151.7612
A tide westering , moondrawn , in her wake .    373.6013
Milk for the pussens , he said .    108.1020
Petals too tired to .    277.2280
I fear those big words , Stephen said , which make us so unhappy .    738.5544
Evening will find itself .    730.8441
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window .    607.5580
Paysayenn .    27.4305
Pepper .    27.4293
The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath .    954.2341
Noon slumbers .    225.8673
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up , saying tritely : Redheaded women buck like goats .    872.9308
He turned to Stephen , saying , as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat : You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints , Kinch , could you ?    530.6083
Lulls all pain .    256.5662
As he and others see me .    315.7285
No .    27.4028
I ’ m going , Mulligan , he said .    113.8954
What , sir ?    114.5384
he asked .    124.6581
You have earned it .    311.2801

Dear Henry , when will we meet ?    818.6646
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God .    462.7608
He emptied his pockets on to the table .    260.6427
Whusky !    227.1298
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe , grey .    427.6482
Come in , ma ’ am , Mulligan said .    181.7280
He himself ?    884.8934
A poet , yes , but an Englishman too .    535.6089
We are a generous people but we must also be just .    1168.0275
The scrotumtightening sea .    479.2007
Watch !    225.4666
Who watches me here ?    1260.3628
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree .    813.7130
Bread , butter , honey .    128.3170
Sex breaking out even then .    745.3468
He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock , resting his ashplant in a grike .    499.7977
Listen .    27.3291
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him .    867.4086
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy .    828.1671
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour , bids her rise .    839.1692
Stephen asked , opening another book .    544.6348
Patrice , home on furlough , lapped warm milk with me in the bar MacMahon .    445.3263
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles , breathing upward sewage breath , a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man ’ s ashes .    765.2956
Good fallback .    340.0626
M ’ Coy nodded , picking at his moustache stubble .    496.6477
Hellenise it .    82.5910
O yes , but I prefer Q .    621.9083
Symbols too of beauty and of power .    289.3057
Snotgreen , bluesilver , rust : coloured signs .    409.5596
he cried thickly .    439.6345
Personally I couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal God .    390.4429
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster , her sails brailed up on the crosstrees , homing , upstream , silently moving , a silent ship .    476.3884
Mrs Ellis ’ s .    81.5775
Clean to see : the gloss of her sleek hide , the white button under the butt of her tail , the green flashing eyes .    375.0022
What does she say ?    697.8400
A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace ( descende !    993.1776
I have seen it coming these years .    754.9678
Milly too .    132.2793
Met him what ?    413.0116
Who has not ?    488.7339
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom .    516.3955
You don ’ t know yet what money is .    389.7303
Poldy !    226.8253
Not unlike her with her hair down : slimmer .    529.1776
The cords of all link back , strandentwining cable of all flesh .    781.8445
Mon fils , soldier of France .    332.7980
A sovereign fell , bright and new , on the soft pile of the tablecloth .    294.5562

Yes , sir .    48.1891
Corny .    27.4274
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit ?    1424.1707
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes .    380.7970
Come .    27.4625
Lap it up like milk , I suppose .    358.8844
Has all vanished since ?    1308.0876
Hoarse , masked and armed , the planters ’ covenant .    213.6483
A sentinel : isle of dreadful thirst .    602.3427
It must have fell down , she said .    330.6854
Shows you the money to be made out of porter .    266.1675
Get rid of him quickly .    382.3091
In cups of rocks it slops : flop , slop , slap : bounded in barrels .    546.3714
Full stop , Mr Deasy bade his keys .    713.2020
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street .    528.3242
Crown of thorns and cross .    391.7340
That do ?    700.3618

Fried with butter , a shake of pepper .    289.6596
A young white heifer .    641.5372
Whrrwhee !    227.1686
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly : That woman is coming up with the milk .    411.2006
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder .    711.0847
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily .    874.7480
Time shocked rebounds , shock by shock .    911.2910
As regards these , he began .    390.7439
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles , dancing coins .    685.5154

He moved a little to the side of M ’ Coy ’ s talking head .    270.8721

That was the rule , said .    112.2848
Son of the wild goose , Kevin Egan of Paris .    335.9464
No - one saw : tell no - one .    836.9828
The aunt thinks you killed your mother , he said .    427.9122
And , spent , its speech ceases .    390.3368
He has the key .    158.6681
Il croit ?    1560.5769
Poor man !    848.5535

As I am .    238.0401
My mother ’ s a jew , my father ’ s a bird .    178.8418
Can ’ t see !    229.1425
He smiled , glancing askance at her mocking eyes .    607.6304
I ’ m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up .    571.0201

The hens in the next garden : their droppings are very good top dressing .    1026.4811
Known as Koch ’ s preparation .    281.5094
Sociable .    27.4302
Where ?    293.9323
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone .    222.9779
Not annoyed then ?    1074.1160
Better ask Seymour that .    669.3944
Hello .    27.2384
The mockery of it !    363.1404
Moist pith of farls of bread , the froggreen wormwood , her matin incense , court the air .    402.4948
History , Stephen said , is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake .    345.6999
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente , not doing a hand ’ s turn all day .    558.4576
O how I long to meet you .    363.6990
he asked .    124.6580
No , nothing has happened .    349.4025
Girl ’ s sweet light lips .    175.4274
It must be a movement then , an actuality of the possible as possible .    441.7990
So much the better .    173.0173
Have you the key ?    216.0505
Stephen freed his arm quietly .    538.9153
Yes , sir .    48.1892
He halted .    245.9236
off it and put it neatly into her mouth .    481.7625
O , do , sir .    89.7718
Or a lilt .    175.7283
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right .    248.0517
Look at that now , she said .    173.3925
Bless us , O Lord , and these thy gifts .    574.0316
Citrons too .    131.9761
Then , gazing over the handkerchief , he said : The bard ’ s noserag !    311.9150
What Paddy ?    1217.5978
Je ne crois pas en l ’ existence de Dieu .    1726.0995
Mulligan , nine pounds , three pairs of socks , one pair brogues , ties .    514.1284

But I will fight for the right till the end .    435.9051
Lovely spot it must be : the garden of the world , big lazy leaves to float about on , cactuses , flowery meads , snaky lianas they call them .    644.4361
Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately ?    1024.4293
To no end gathered ; vainly then released , forthflowing , wending back : loom of the moon .    797.4692
Put down three and carry five .    648.4755
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock , carefully .    583.6519
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop .    728.8037
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions ?    1448.6033
Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee .    559.5245
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells : et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam : the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts , a chemistry of stars .    1027.7001
Yes , bread of angels it ’ s called .    197.0814
Open your eyes now .    342.6245
Thanks , old chap , he cried briskly .    262.2672
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa .    929.9095
Go further next time .    790.6360
She tendered a coin , smiling boldly , holding her thick wrist out .    695.5056
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon : Heva , naked Eve .    793.3926
Yes , Mr Bloom said .    160.6608

Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel .    692.6329
Who ’ s behind me ?    129.7013
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope , ripping it open in jerks .    498.5338
Young student .    351.1236
No great hurry .    461.3332
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript .    832.0394
It does .    166.9581
he said gaily .    271.1978
Comment ?    293.7482
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically .    897.1379
They were about him here and there , with heads still bowed in their crimson halters , waiting for it to melt in their stomachs .    695.8224
Sees me looking .    340.3643
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head , coach after coach .    1146.3167

Music hall stage .    645.4343
What perfume does your wife use .    940.0342
In all the highest places : her finance , her press .    330.3973
Still they get their feed all right and their doss .    855.4062
O , rocks !    232.2487
Tiptop , thanks .    73.2009
Hokypoky penny a lump .    447.2164
Makes you feel young .    340.5286
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat .    897.3843
Threepence , please .    98.6495
Ffoo !    227.1532
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly : What is the matter ?    731.3370
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine .    1235.7360
O , Milly Bloom , you are my darling .    281.1736
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength .    685.6265
The King ’ s own .    126.8171
Mark my words , Mr Dedalus , he said .    207.6546
And skeweyed Walter sirring his father , no less !    1335.7904
The twining stresses , two by two .    691.7141
He stared at them proudly , piled stone mammoth skulls .    1249.7755
You could have knelt down , damn it , Kinch , when your dying mother asked you , Buck Mulligan said .    509.3693
Secondleg they should be .    482.6946
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay , his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly .    821.5635
You were going to do wonders , what ?    659.7106
After all , I should think you are able to free yourself .    598.9421
Walter squints vainly for a chair .    619.8451
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs , the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman , a butcher ’ s dame , nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange .    557.8845
O , weeping God , the things I married into !    520.1187
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches .    646.3580
Language no whit worse than his .    840.2258
What about that , eh ?    394.2756
Then , a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking : rumpled , shiny sole .    741.5480
I ’ m coming , Buck Mulligan answered .    297.6931
The air feeds most .    1215.6863
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man ’ s stare .    370.9531
No .    27.4027
O , O .    59.4385
Lover , for her love he prowled with colonel Richard Burke , tanist of his sept , under the walls of Clerkenwell and , crouching , saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward in the fog .    506.2378
The other one , jar on her head , was getting the supper : fruit , olives , lovely cool water out of a well , stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown .    512.9095
Shouldering their bags they trudged , the red Egyptians .    619.3331
All .    27.7705
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes .    603.8968
He has washed the upper moiety .    770.6758
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly , shadowing the bay in deeper green .    646.1725
I see little hope , Stephen said , from her or from him .    290.9499
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves .    829.3404
Dringadring !    227.1283
He stood up , gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown , saying resignedly : Mulligan is stripped of his garments .    618.1479
Buck Mulligan asked .    294.3346
Rhythm begins , you see .    220.4059
And he said : Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy !    1320.1670
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin , twisted it round in his fingers and cried : A miracle !    795.1560
Moi , je suis socialiste .    780.2542
I have my stick .    345.9811
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish : the last .    476.4055
He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet , laughing to himself .    497.1145
The shiny links , packed with forcemeat , fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs ’ blood .    858.3333
I . . . With him together down . . .    103.8527
No , sir .    48.4350
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa , chap ticking them off in a book , navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees .    840.9333
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor .    327.5224
Pretending to speak broken English as you dragged your valise , porter threepence , across the slimy pier at Newhaven .    960.4763
He threw it on the road .    238.1033
You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street .    938.0819
The crooked skirt swinging , whack by whack by whack .    1509.7290
Good morning , sir , Stephen said again , bowing to his bent back .    267.5074
They swarmed loud , uncouth about the temple , their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats .    967.9387
Chucked medicine and going in for the army .    330.5565
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam .    767.5007
No use canvassing him for an ad .    872.4211
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted .    877.6475
Mr Bloom , strolling towards Brunswick street , smiled .    542.0652
We ’ ll be choked , Buck Mulligan said .    329.6499
Maud Gonne ’ s letter about taking them off O ’ Connell street at night : disgrace to our Irish capital .    775.0599
About a million barrels all the same .    344.7619
To Caesar what is Caesar ’ s , to God what is God ’ s .    246.6268
Just C . P . M ’ Coy will do .    327.1437
Goes like this .    268.3820
Is it Paddy Dignam ?    1196.7572
Naked nymphs : Greece : and for instance all the people that lived then .    557.3881
If anyone thinks that I amn ’ t divine He ’ ll get no free drinks when I ’ m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again .    1200.1300
Simple bit of paper .    293.2982
Eleven , is it ?    110.3392
I know the voice .    159.1774
Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head .    1159.4386
He stood suddenly , his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil .    538.8541
Spurned and undespairing .    234.4770
Yet here ’ s a spot .    150.7107
Give us that key , Kinch , Buck Mulligan said , to keep my chemise flat .    467.6180
Meade ’ s timberyard .    45.4396
Dying , he said again , if not dead by now .    277.6871
Why ?    294.9033
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree , for instance .    833.4093
My missus has just got an engagement .    1307.3069
Doesn ’ t see me .    128.8446
A thing out in the water .    178.1574
Square it you with the boss and we ’ ll split the job , see ?    366.3857
What ’ s left us then ?    249.0926
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers , leaned upon his spear .    804.8452
Like me , like Algy , coming down to our mighty mother .    486.0564
In a moment they will laugh more loudly , aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay .    662.0334
And past Nichols ’ the undertaker .    373.3197
Influence of the climate .    79.7559
Watering cart .    424.7729
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner , nursing his hat and newspaper .    650.3461
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers .    813.0699
Buck Mulligan said .    143.3092
He ’ s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks , is he ?    532.6771
Why , sir ?    114.3899
I don ’ t mince words , do I ?    490.6297
All I can give you I give .    539.7441
Her head dancing .    423.5905
Down , sir !    147.2136
Poor old professor Goodwin .    748.3500
Haines sat down on a stone , smoking .    296.1822
Wombed in sin darkness I was too , made not begotten .    578.9337
So warm .    200.6522
Darkness is in our souls do you not think ?    828.2322
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker .    299.8935
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight ?    377.2230
Drink water scented with fennel , sherbet .    495.1674
And when I makes water I makes water .    835.0641
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch .    803.0887
Silly Milly ’ s birthday gift .    275.3596
The only true thing in life ?    1146.0356
She serves me at his beck .    479.0808
Where ?    293.9325
If I fell over a cliff that beetles o ’ er his base , fell through the nebeneinander ineluctably !    943.4538
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees , hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield .    456.1553
I see you ’ re . . . O , no , Mr Bloom said .    139.1164
Why , I wonder .    108.9863
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand , a rag of wolf ’ s tongue redpanting from his jaws .    594.1641
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair .    800.3690
I ’ m coming , Stephen said , turning .    168.4899
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth , hiding and revealing its yellow glow .    632.3378
Six weeks off , however .    473.9805
Yes , sir .    48.1890
Just loll there : quiet dusk : let everything rip .    1353.4072
A bit at a time .    286.0039
Ay !    227.3423
Ceasing , he began to shave with care .    316.1802
Not this Monsieur , I said .    199.4050
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets .    574.8704
You know , Dedalus , you have the real Oxford manner .    363.6086
Cough it up .    162.1033
He put the huge key in his inner pocket .    516.9606
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’ s face .    404.9143
Then the next one .    204.9047
He ’ s English , Buck Mulligan said , and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland .    303.4236
It ’ s about the foot and mouth disease .    231.1732
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here .    1574.9105
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day .    556.3061
Well : slainte !    576.4473
I will see if I can see .    570.7890
Your postprandial , do you know that word ?    642.6462
Here .    27.5173
She raised a gloved hand to her hair .    462.9337
A merchant , Stephen said , is one who buys cheap and sells dear , jew or gentile , is he not ?    586.6818
Haines , who had been laughing guardedly , walked on beside Stephen and said : We oughtn ’ t to laugh , I suppose .    524.4667
He has nowhere to put it , you mug .    370.0703
He threw it .    238.9598
Other stocking .    292.2626
To come to the point at issue .    370.8260
Red carpet spread .    1024.4821
Old style .    447.1635
But one day you must feel it .    503.1667
No , sir .    48.4350
There again : the overtone following through the air .    394.5042
Three times now .    290.3130
He held the page aslant patiently , bending his senses and his will , his soft subject gaze at rest .    673.8009
On earth as it is in heaven .    371.1741
Here , she said .    59.2001
He stooped and gathered them .    526.8178
Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again , he said , and show them to you , sir .    312.7101
A quart , Stephen said .    151.0733
The way of all our old industries .    607.8588
Very well then , I contradict myself .    552.8619
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail .    760.7099
Cocklepickers .    27.4271
He thinks you ’ re not a gentleman .    330.0543
My father gave me seeds to sow .    772.5549
You pique my curiosity , Haines said amiably .    546.5587
Pert little piece she was .    640.3709
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard , their land a pawnshop .    998.3616
I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms , who left the house of his father and left the God of his father .    466.9560
Dead : an old woman ’ s : the grey sunken cunt of the world .    258.4188
He turned over the smudged pages .    392.6464
What time ?    504.3492
Lascivious people .    296.0511
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars : priest with a scroll rolled up .    520.2101
And he said : Another victory like that and we are done for .    644.7278
He turned back quickly , coughing , laughing , his lifted arms waving to the air .    436.1723
This dogsbody to rid of vermin .    496.0309
A pier , sir , Armstrong said .    182.0470
I suppose I did say it .    484.9343
After a silence Cochrane said : What is it , sir ?    514.8978
Click does the trick .    241.3408
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by , amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss .    918.4449
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall .    777.1160
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble , fanshoals of fishes , silly shells .    500.4642
By a woman who was no better than she should be .    847.4961
No wind could lift those waves , grey metal , poisonous foggy waters .    1162.2018
At Plevna that was .    390.9569
Was given milk too long .    671.9467
Pointed cuffs .    245.4776
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh .    1329.4697
They followed the winding path down to the creek .    347.7266
With it an abode of bliss .    474.2964
Try it anyhow .    225.5336
he asked , turning .    169.2577
God , isn ’ t he dreadful ?    283.6445

Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips .    233.6203
It came nearer up the staircase , calling again .    449.8769
As it was in the beginning , is now .    174.6878
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom .    648.9849
Well , sir , he began .    100.5247
Now could you make out a thing like that ?    606.8391
There ’ s whatdoyoucallhim out of .    109.8676
He walked off quickly round the parapet .    633.3868
I ’ m quite frank with you .    320.2908
Redcoats .    27.4267
Will happen too .    526.7253
A hand plucking the harpstrings , merging their twining chords .    903.7113
Is she up the pole ?    451.8718
He said .    71.8275
The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand , crouched in flight .    922.7974
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face .    938.1002
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness .    956.4818
We give it up .    233.5817
Doesn ’ t see .    94.1204
She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man , madame in rue G t - le - C ur , canary and two buck lodgers .    1418.3038
I ’ m swelled after that cabbage .    428.2057
Loose tobaccoshreds catch fire : a flame and acrid smoke light our corner .    1256.6542
Open hallway .    246.2800
You have eaten all we left , I suppose .    585.9602
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands .    1045.7627
Bread and butter , four , sugar , spoon , her cream .    268.9457
That woman at midnight mass .    833.0756
Something new and easy .    420.5845
How much ?    608.5612
Cat furry black ball .    978.6464
Good day to you .    131.7099
The protestants are the same .    264.8584
Out of her clothes somewhere : pinned together .    591.3283
Still he knows his own business best .    747.8470
Thanks , old man .    137.1801
Chapped : washingsoda .    181.1325
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them , chiding them , and to his dangling watchchain .    584.1260
Look at yourself , he said , you dreadful bard !    395.6942
He came to the table , pinning together his sheets .    303.5996
Dominie Deasy kens them a ’ .    411.2820
Goodbye now , naughty darling , I have such a bad headache .    503.4381
Soft soft soft hand .    587.7736
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent , ending .    446.8868
Police tout .    305.4758
Hello .    27.2385
Give her too much meat she won ’ t mouse .    760.9904
Coming out of her shell .    219.2274
Tell Pat you saw me , won ’ t you ?    434.1748
Josssticks burning .    311.4061
Illustration .    27.4273
Fine .    27.4275
Disguises , clutched at , gone , not here .    192.5115
Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker .    378.7921
If Wilde were only alive to see you !    1308.6091
My Latin quarter hat .    636.0811
He will ask for it .    385.4735
Loam , what is this that is ?    324.8868
O si , certo !    812.0710
By Jove , it is tea , Haines said .    215.2001
Well ?    292.9314
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning .    405.7694
All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream , Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf .    502.1607
I am not a strong swimmer .    453.3156
Mrkgnao !    227.1487
Janey Mack , I ’ m choked !    404.0757
And here crowns .    500.9788
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry .    607.2767
Would you like a cup , ma ’ am ?    380.6924
On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall , paused by the bedroom door .    498.5663
Quietly he read , restraining himself , the first column and , yielding but resisting , began the second .    377.7187
Shoot him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun , bits man spattered walls all brass buttons .    1076.5552
Brimstone they called it raining down : the cities of the plain : Sodom , Gomorrah , Edom .    372.9491
Gabble of geese .    188.4903
he asked .    124.6580
There ’ s five fathoms out there , he said .    169.5314
It called again .    314.0145
But it has a Hellenic ring , hasn ’ t it ?    436.5986
Two , he said , strapping and stowing his pocketbook away .    268.6634
The ballad of joking Jesus , Stephen answered .    472.1486
Wake this time next year .    772.1291
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair .    904.0285
All days make their end .    723.6440
Down in Westmeath .    220.3276
Joseph the Joiner ?    435.8629
Some laughed again : mirthless but with meaning .    949.0886
Enthusiast .    27.4252
Yes , but W is wonderful .    429.3390
Better find out in the paper .    226.8809
What a lark .    221.6042
My consubstantial father ’ s voice .    242.9948
Stephen , still trembling at his soul ’ s cry , heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words .    535.3286
Like him was I , these sloping shoulders , this gracelessness .    503.0148
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong .    777.8730
Wonder did she wrote it herself .    582.3078
Make hay while the sun shines .    585.8085
Or through M ’ Coy .    363.4906
Elfin riders sat them , watchful of a sign .    489.0983
Epi oinopa ponton .    662.7637
Doing the indignant : a girl of good family like me , respectable character .    529.5734
Cruel .    27.4264
The lump I have is useless .    528.1663
Do you think she was ?    514.5383
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror , while all prayed on their knees .    1034.4105
Iubilantium te virginum .    867.0054
They clasped and sundered , did the coupler ’ s will .    256.1443
Lump of love .    139.3550
Yes .    27.4027
Biting her nether lip , hooking the placket of her skirt .    491.0782
I couldn ’ t believe it when I heard it .    373.0519
I didn ’ t mean to offend the memory of your mother .    360.0323
Cries of sellers in the streets .    194.4760
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe , linked together in the rain .    419.6770
I never borrowed a shilling in my life .    615.0205
Stop and say a word : about the funeral perhaps .    364.9796
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it .    597.1518
The seas ’ ruler , he gazed southward over the bay , empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins .    541.7482
Night sky , moon , violet , colour of Molly ’ s new garters .    320.9126
Travel round in front of the sun , steal a day ’ s march on him .    286.6269
A tolerant smile curled his lips .    804.7696
Well , meet him .    116.8835
Our mighty mother !    1652.1180
Remember .    27.5684
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam ’ s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death .    960.4419
The priest ’ s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly .    543.5812
Do you know what I ’ m going to tell you ?    457.1643
Fergus ’ song : I sang it alone in the house , holding down the long dark chords .    454.1664
What is that ?    242.7807
I forget .    133.8293
A little trouble about those white corpuscles .    1362.0969
Mrkrgnao !    227.1332
Curse your noisy pugnose .    817.5318
Iago , Stephen murmured .    126.5614
He approached Larry O ’ Rourke ’ s .    325.7872
Percentage of salted horses .    510.4104
I ’ m hyperborean as much as you .    466.8970
A choir gives back menace and echo , assisting about the altar ’ s horns , the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs , tonsured and oiled and gelded , fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat .    609.1596
The virgin at Hodges Figgis ’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write .    823.5262
Encore deux minutes .    1107.6273
Clearly I can see today .    569.1331
Made him feel a bit peckish .    528.2521
Two in the back bench whispered .    295.8792
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar .    604.7480
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket .    354.3690
She listens with big dark soft eyes .    887.1249
The same young eyes .    439.4084
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay : it seems history is to blame : on me and on my words , unhating .    555.2399
Bleibtreustrasse <NUMBER> , Berlin , W . <NUMBER> .    245.7469
Prefer an ounce of opium .    530.0084
Hand in hand .    158.6606
Taking it easy with hand under his cheek .    566.2005
Buck Mulligan , hewing thick slices from the loaf , said in an old woman ’ s wheedling voice : When I makes tea I makes tea , as old mother Grogan said .    596.7801
Just there .    196.8465
Friend of the family .    72.4603
Life might be so .    469.0901
Stephen asked .    170.8868
His hand turned the page over .    381.1751
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus ?    1013.7813
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate : toothless terrors .    720.1830
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek .    1134.7345
They halted , looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale .    581.5591
A cored apple , filled with brown sugar , roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening .    669.3140
They have forgotten Kevin Egan , not he them .    466.6088
He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand towards the Pigeonhouse .    637.6192
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun .    1295.9482
Never read it .    142.1662
What is it now ?    284.1856
Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh ’ s library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas .    543.4288
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere ?    712.6010
Yes ?    294.0609
You fenians forget some things .    1486.8906
She poured more tea into her cup , watching it flow sideways .    793.6836
Metempsychosis , he said , frowning .    81.4580
Shells .    27.4258
Spooning with him last night on the pier .    349.3937
Good idea the Latin .    198.1298
And Monsieur Drumont , gentleman journalist .    754.6335
O , that ’ s all right .    91.6182
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets : choice blend , finest quality , family tea .    784.2073
Ripening now .    118.3660
What had Gretta Conroy on ?    1335.3032
Stephen ’ s hand , free again , went back to the hollow shells .    220.2755
That means the transmigration of souls .    376.6674
A lex eterna stays about Him .    1354.7676
Strong pair of arms .    334.4911
Just you give it a fair trial .    414.8239
It does her all right .    368.6957
Ought I go to a dentist , I wonder , with that money ?    315.8115
I ’ m not a believer myself , that is to say .    267.8311
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching .    1098.4209
Conscience .    27.4268
No thanks at all , Mr Deasy said .    368.8457
I mean , a believer in the narrow sense of the word .    216.9047
The Father and the Son idea .    264.9301
The Ship , half twelve .    440.4566
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman ’ s mouth ?    658.7578
Talk that to someone else , Stevie : a pickmeup .    355.9355
He drones bars of Ferrando ’ s aria di sortita .    700.0129
She praised the goodness of the milk , pouring it out .    262.9030
Moisture about gives long sight perhaps .    948.0908
Good morning , sir .    150.6194
Nosebag time .    206.6644
A woful lunatic !    2683.9895
So in the moon ’ s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks , in sable silvered , hearing Elsinore ’ s tempting flood .    439.6286
Terribilia meditans .    223.3570
I got a card from Bannon .    495.4105
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat .    449.3625
I ’ d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden .    1037.5527
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting , went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors .    774.1118
For a woman who was no better than she should be , Helen , the runaway wife of Menelaus , ten years the Greeks made war on Troy .    697.0814

I will .    159.0547
Rinderpest .    27.4274
I fancy , Stephen said as he ate , it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion .    354.1658
Well ?    292.9323
He sighed down his nose : they never understand .    810.7756
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and .    472.5241
On the spindle side .    324.2946
The father is rotto with money .    514.7667
Sure we ought to , the old woman said , and I ’ m ashamed I don ’ t speak the language myself .    352.0136
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly .    1056.7305
He laps .    462.6295
I am another now and yet the same .    379.4452
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it .    489.7618
A boat would be near , a lifebuoy .    506.5268
Three pounds three .    550.4506
Ah , wanted to go upstairs , curl up in a ball on the bed .    306.8862

I want puce gloves .    812.9385
Get another of Paul de Kock ’ s .    393.8499
All kings ’ sons .    408.9725
Common pin , eh ?    734.8193
I am a struggler now at the end of my days .    399.0155
Making his day ’ s stations , the dingy printingcase , his three taverns , the Montmartre lair he sleeps short night in , rue de la Goutte - d ’ Or , damascened with flyblown faces of the gone .    595.2207
I ’ m glad I didn ’ t go into the room to look at his face .    402.3946
You know that red Carlisle girl , Lily ?    973.4603
Croppies lie down .    577.9313
of course .    251.2104
A very short space of time through very short times of space .    985.3297
That a man ’ s soul after he dies .    310.3456
Haines said .    71.2041
A voice within the tower called loudly : Are you up there , Mulligan ?    729.6678
Ireland , they say , has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews .    427.5642
Hook it quick .    214.7737
And the story , sir ?    251.7941
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips .    725.9077
Such a bad headache .    379.1956
Jesus wept : and no wonder , by Christ !    630.2709
Hands stuck in his trousers ’ pockets , jarvey off for the day , singing .    371.1267
On the night of the seventeenth of February <NUMBER> the prisoner was seen by two witnesses .    621.7485
I ’ ll show you my likeness one day .    597.5378
What have you up your nose against me ?    819.0234
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead : And no more turn aside and brood Upon love ’ s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars .    971.7651
Better buy one .    436.5659
Well , perhaps it was best for him .    322.0479
Heavy of the past .    60.9595
Women all for caste till you touch the spot .    600.2971
Sit down or by the law Harry I ’ ll knock you down .    618.9608
His plump body plunged .    741.8468
But he adds : in bodies .    324.5702
That one .    155.6239
Time enough .    209.4073
What else were they invented for ?    1733.1584
Runs , she runs to meet me , a girl with gold hair on the wind .    317.1303
Esprit de corps .    653.6157
Someone was to read them there after a few thousand years , a mahamanvantara .    566.3615
Thank you : not having any .    312.7970
We ’ ll see you again , Haines said , turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish .    440.7999
She might like something tasty .    786.5208
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice .    548.6628
O , Haines said , you have heard it before ?    309.1867
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father .    561.5792
May I trespass on your valuable space .    743.0013
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away , well in , and kneel an instant before it , showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on .    708.3719
Etiquette is etiquette .    304.3976
Her full lips , drinking , smiled .    311.3835
Haines said again .    202.6512
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe ’ s rooms .    626.2900
Careless air : just drop in to see .    453.8165
Prime sausage .    380.9441

he exclaimed .    201.6927
I said .    71.7571
Her first birthday away from home .    887.0264
The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus , he said .    528.0016
Do you know that ?    311.7053
He drank at her bidding .    535.6102
It ’ s Stephen , sir .    50.4072
God , we ’ ll simply have to dress the character .    395.4061
Got up wrong side of the bed .    303.1691
And Ristori in Vienna .    488.3333
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea , tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in .    615.6537
He creased out the letter at his side , reading it slowly as he chewed , sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth .    464.6972
Stephen sketched a brief gesture .    767.1842
Castoff soldier .    302.7898
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy ’ s , clutching a naggin bottle by the neck .    585.3481
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money .    1240.4713
She lapped slower , then licking the saucer clean .    836.4402
Pity so empty .    500.4482
One and four into twenty : fifteen about .    714.4764
Like foul flowerwater .    587.9120

That ’ ll be all right .    355.0529
To keep it up .    276.4266
Hray !    227.1217
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan ’ s ( I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan ’ s ) song about those seaside girls .    1075.9850

Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade .    373.2028
They sinned against the light , Mr Deasy said gravely .    515.9172
Nice name he has .    375.5277
Windows open .    352.8828
I will not sleep here tonight .    763.6093

He took the hilt of his ashplant , lunging with it softly , dallying still .    397.1483
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table , mewing .    567.5767
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief .    1167.4396
Off the drunks perhaps .    352.9769

It ’ s nine days today .    211.3270

You ’ re not a believer , are you ?    298.8474
With mother ’ s money order , eight shillings , the banging door of the post office slammed in your face by the usher .    440.7484
Another time .    206.7668

In the trousers I left off .    500.8794
Wander through awned streets .    1031.1951

Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers ’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles .    577.9796
My handkerchief .    194.5591
the cat said loudly .    453.7563
Give you the needle that would .    317.0598
He died on Monday , poor fellow .    493.4974
Always the same , year after year .    337.8609

he said quietly .    185.5487
I hear them at the piano downstairs .    425.1725
The truth , spit it out .    348.2923
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him , moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water .    548.4408
We did great biz yesterday .    923.3511
Yes , what is it ?    170.9279
Per second per second .    768.5638
Kind of stuff you read : in the track of the sun .    208.7558
Might manage a sketch .    376.0255
A phrase , then , of impatience , thud of Blake ’ s wings of excess .    267.0884

Fabled by the daughters of memory .    242.7105
How are you ?    313.0584
Kingstown pier , Stephen said .    141.5894
Stephen , an elbow rested on the jagged granite , leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve .    762.4483
The soul is in a manner all that is : the soul is the form of forms .    349.0403
O , my name for you is the best : Kinch , the knife - blade .    346.3307
But I couldn ’ t go in that light suit .    455.8643
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses .    1105.0824
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech , confidently .    515.0840
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws , a lady of letters .    542.0869
Then feel all like one family party , same in the theatre , all in the same swim .    425.3550
Let me be and let me live .    490.8026
Ham and eggs , no .    189.5899
It bore the oldest , the first race .    353.2807
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last : Rather bleak in wintertime , I should say .    743.2532
They like them sizeable .    582.3114
That must be why the women go after them .    673.1779
Proudly walking .    214.7503
Funny I don ’ t remember that .    255.1447
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes .    815.0784

I would want to .    288.3626
Valise I have a particular fancy for .    555.6534
Well ?    292.9322
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back .    489.4333
They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently , Frauenzimmer : and down the shelving shore flabbily , their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand .    592.6627
he murmured to himself .    377.1529
What did you say that for ?    481.5601
Not like Ecce Homo .    946.3220
Families of them .    101.3854
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone .    1132.8125
Warm sunshine merrying over the sea .    484.0852
He leaned back and went on again , having just remembered .    598.3975
Sit down a moment .    201.8885
Some say they remember their past lives .    1012.1101
Then he put a forkful into his mouth , chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat .    741.0135
Haines said , beginning to point at Stephen .    273.0859
Cup of tea now .    183.1477
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth , murmuring all the time .    478.4660
Who ’ s getting it up ?    158.2559
Of lost leaders , the betrayed , wild escapes .    404.6157
Turning the curve he waved his hand .    410.1248
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads .    898.7543
They all fall to the ground .    227.1666
Their Eldorado .    297.9359
Barrels bumped in his head : dull porter slopped and churned inside .    814.2303
On the hands down .    186.6316
He passed it along the table towards the old woman , saying : Ask nothing more of me , sweet .    420.3377
Are there any letters for me ?    937.0090
Buck Mulligan , walking forward again , raised his hands .    361.8239
No : that book .    209.5683
Stephen asked .    170.8865
She curtseyed and went out , followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant : Heart of my heart , were it more , More would be laid at your feet .    609.9667
He coasted them , walking warily .    681.5777
The drone of his misleading whistle brings Walter back .    907.1943
Liliata rutilantium .    249.0655
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket .    860.4248
A flower .    360.2736
He liked thick giblet soup , nutty gizzards , a stuffed roast heart , liverslices fried with crustcrumbs , fried hencods ’ roes .    898.5790
There he is .    112.2204
A server of a servant .    238.1376
No guts in it .    214.4293
Beauty is not there .    203.9610
I feel so bad about .    801.0307
The cat went up in soft bounds .    725.6848
He says it ’ s very clever .    279.1639
Usual love scrimmage .    408.9255
Well , I am here now .    225.4440
White breast of the dim sea .    300.5338
So .    27.6490
With the Bannons .    146.1141
Why not endless till the farthest star ?    1199.8198
I thirst .    203.0540
Nothing doing .    225.9319
Eyes front .    314.9406
A million pounds , wait a moment .    407.2095
I hope that smallpox up there doesn ’ t get worse .    770.5799
Now that was farseeing .    321.7849
What ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet ’ s breezy . . . Goodbye , now , goodbye !    319.7526
Damn it .    82.7678
The king was in his countinghouse .    356.6382
Only five she was then .    460.4462
Heaviness : hot day coming .    428.7195
He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread , impaled on his knife .    589.1221
Your wife and my wife .    391.3115
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and , glancing at Haines and Stephen , crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone .    595.2468
Who was telling me ?    844.3526
Cheeseparing nose .    294.4750
That is Kevin Egan ’ s movement I made , nodding for his nap , sabbath sleep .    497.0372
The Ship , Buck Mulligan cried .    371.0278
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid ?    1078.0830
Dogskull , dogsniff , eyes on the ground , moves to one great goal .    289.6118
Russell , one guinea , Cousins , ten shillings , Bob Reynolds , half a guinea , Koehler , three guineas , Mrs MacKernan , five weeks ’ board .    502.7707
Might be happy all the same that way .    416.8138
They take me for a dun , peer out from a coign of vantage .    497.4650
The new air greeted him , harping in wild nerves , wind of wild air of seeds of brightness .    665.3776
Let him stay , Stephen said .    188.2289
I think of you so often you have no idea .    571.8638
Would you like a bite of something ?    448.4389
The flood is following me .    529.8174
To provoke the rain .    358.3082
Not a bit funky .    418.3769
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers .    832.0549
Of course I ’ m a Britisher , Haines ’ s voice said , and I feel as one .    279.1132
No , she can jump me .    319.2814
<NUMBER> B . C . Asculum , Stephen said , glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book .    276.7637
Spoils slung at her back .    382.1407
By the way no harm .    462.8456
I ’ d go if I possibly could .    774.2310
Softsoaping .    27.4269
Stephen rustled the sheets again .    594.3851
Buss her , wap in rogues ’ rum lingo , for , O , my dimber wapping dell !    602.1092
A kind of a bridge .    227.8000
Hothouse in Botanic gardens .    556.4769

I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman .    1742.9919
I ’ m the bermensch .    158.3623
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts .    577.9677
Gone .    27.4640
A shout in the street , Stephen answered , shrugging his shoulders .    260.9920
Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea .    468.0883
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand , trotting , sniffing on all sides .    653.5805
What are you singing ?    664.7485
There is no time to lose .    364.9628
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn ’ t live .    649.5809
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head .    602.9495
From whom ?    720.9190
We ’ re always tired in the morning , Stephen said to Haines .    252.9039
It ’ s a law something like that .    182.6134
Coloured on a flat : yes , that ’ s right .    197.4477
M . Fifteen yesterday .    299.0746
Then what is it ?    314.4227
The cat , having cleaned all her fur , returned to the meatstained paper , nosed at it and stalked to the door .    438.0784
Just how she stalks over my writingtable .    771.4560
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone , in shirtsleeves , his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder .    468.0416
Gaze in your omphalos .    247.2664
Some people believe , he said , that we go on living in another body after death , that we lived before .    572.4771
Poor Dignam !    1112.3173
Irish Homestead .    212.9608

Go on then , Talbot .    192.6365
Pyrrhus , sir ?    114.0490
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and , bending in loose laughter , said to Stephen ’ s ear : O , shade of Kinch the elder !    528.5441
Talk : as if that would mend matters .    867.5099
He walked along the upwardcurving path .    548.4701
Four shining sovereigns , Buck Mulligan cried with delight .    616.0208
Just one moment .    251.4400
Soft day , sir John !    611.4248
Hello , M ’ Coy .    126.8489
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland .    716.3215
Like to see her again in that .    240.6604
More tell me , more still !    655.0329
Would I make any money by it ?    911.2589
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday .    1336.0154
Haines stood at the doorway , looking out .    257.6488
That is why mystic monks .    999.0902
Mrs Marion .    199.4767
His arm .    217.4619
Have you read his F ?    572.8080
Buck Mulligan said .    143.3095
Number eighty still unlet .    990.9863
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare ’ s ghost is Hamlet ’ s grandfather .    468.9361
You ’ ll look spiffing in them .    453.2274
Our prize titbit : Matcham ’ s Masterstroke .    379.0600
Must get those settled really .    1183.0070
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her .    590.4617
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word ?    673.9632
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow .    847.4415
Haines sat down to pour out the tea .    335.6200
Womb of sin .    158.3297
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows .    737.1014
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem .    480.7773
Watch !    225.4665
No black clouds anywhere , are there ?    1040.3206
Say he got ten per cent off .    1320.4962
One of the best , M ’ Coy said .    155.1846
Hooray !    227.1285
O ’ Brien .    157.5472
They ’ re taught that .    244.8643
McCann , one guinea .    133.7099
To learn one must be humble .    862.8316
she cried , running to lap .    280.0120
With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table , with trousers down at heels , chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears .    569.3687
Thanks : new tam : Mr Coghlan : lough Owel picnic : young student : Blazes Boylan ’ s seaside girls .    878.5758
The cracked lookingglass of a servant .    367.4177
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak .    1052.2072
Her slim legs running up the staircase .    611.5432
Ah , poor dogsbody !    433.9997
God !    227.8260
And a letter for you .    191.1952
You had better get your stick and go out to the others , Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form .    473.5703
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes , rearing horses , rocks .    662.9742
Agendath Netaim : planters ’ company .    547.1251
Weary too in sight of lovers , lascivious men , a naked woman shining in her courts , she draws a toil of waters .    500.5112
At one , he said .    95.0213
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade .    494.0446
Costive .    27.4287
What is your idea of Hamlet ?    597.6273
Arbutus place : Pleasants street : pleasant old times .    1043.8242
There ’ s only one sense of the word , it seems to me , Stephen said .    179.7466
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs , nebeneinander .    409.8888
Sleeping sickness in the air .    189.1244
Leaving the door ajar , amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces .    651.9439
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth .    677.2927
Cyril Sargent : his name and seal .    402.6718
It ’ s all right .    65.9280
The figures whitened in his mind , unsolved : displeased , he let them fade .    639.5348
Then he put on his hat again , relieved : and read again : choice blend , made of the finest Ceylon brands .    501.5526
Hair ?    294.5424
Shut your eyes and see .    261.8084
I hear .    135.4591
Who is my neighbour ?    773.5840
He faced about and back again .    515.3628
It suits me splendid .    705.4850
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone , scarcely having been .    1274.1237
All human history moves towards one great goal , the manifestation of God .    657.5211
The Russians , they ’ d only be an eight o ’ clock breakfast for the Japanese .    758.7135
E . . . eleven , Mr Bloom answered .    156.3664
Signs on a white field .    279.4110
Mr Deasy is calling you .    414.4456
But what does Shakespeare say ?    1348.0369
Yes , Mr Bloom said .    160.6608
Old hag with the yellow teeth .    396.9001
Haines , come in .    106.2892
The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror , he said .    382.0869
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality .    454.8540
Twopence a pint , fourpence a quart , eightpence a gallon of porter , no , one and fourpence a gallon of porter .    372.0631
Table : able .    167.2826
His head disappeared and reappeared .    576.5232
The Evening Telegraph . . . That will do , Mr Deasy said .    300.1919
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him .    424.4653
Buck Mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight .    232.7090
Damn all else they are good for .    699.6679
Chewer of corpses !    598.2280
she said .    51.1636
Time enough , sir , she said , taking the coin .    174.6409
Fifteen multiplied by .    708.0035
Queer I was just thinking that moment .    684.2026
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord , hushed in ruddy wool .    759.8185
No , the dog .    47.2780
Then he went to the dresser , took the jug Hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him , poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor .    465.9926
Pier with lamps , summer evening , band .    411.5032
My twelfth rib is gone , he cried .    493.0272
Most licentious custom .    876.0754
Then think of the competition .    173.5739
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight , putting back his savingsbox .    747.3572
Keen glance you gave her .    400.3989
You might put down my name at the funeral , will you ?    520.8774
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings , darned with lumpy wool .    1085.3129
Why did you enclose the stamps ?    644.8948
Sleep six months out of twelve .    559.9807
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker .    222.0353
Where is my hat , by the way ?    294.7745
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up , roll over to the sun a puffy face , saltwhite .    706.0453
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after .    815.4594
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks , cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket , his hat tilted down on his eyes .    647.5399
Wife is oldish .    295.1240
They will walk on it tonight , coming here in the dark .    319.8275
He carried it upstairs , his thumb hooked in the teapot handle .    528.3051
Then , lo and behold , they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons .    914.4678
Plasters on a sore eye .    341.8528
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly , an elbow on the pillow .    665.7849
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand .    245.4529
Reading , lying back now , counting the strands of her hair , smiling , braiding .    298.1261
Speaking to me .    123.6788
She asked you who was in your room .    495.8924
Cigar has a cooling effect .    641.8350
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly , showing an open copybook .    1405.1034
Hello , Bloom .    56.6331
No good eggs with this drouth .    818.4566
Listen .    27.3291
To evening lands .    617.3308
What is that , a bob here and there , dribs and drabs .    299.6512
Who ever anywhere will read these written words ?    2217.3999
And Mr ?    547.9561
It ’ s in the lock , Stephen said , coming forward .    128.3692
It sat there , dull and squat , its spout stuck out .    641.7747
Yes , my love ?    239.0733
Or was that only possible which came to pass ?    1005.9098
No , they will pass on , passing , chafing against the low rocks , swirling , passing .    402.2118
Call away let him : thy quarrons dainty is .    1007.3983
Talbot asked simply , bending forward .    531.3453
See now .    118.3563
I got mummy ’ s lovely box of creams and am writing .    586.4639
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were ?    1952.5369
Stephen said .    71.0749
A hard one , sir .    252.4608
Morning mouth bad images .    751.8915
Then come out a bit spreeish .    503.4516
It ’ s not fair to tease you like that , Kinch , is it ?    221.5896
It is very simple , Stephen said as he stood up .    382.6956
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter .    320.0881
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues .    500.7321
Poor papa !    1077.0913
Nothing she can eat ?    1104.7705
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke .    756.9168
The words troubled their gaze .    778.9319
Everything on it ?    211.5433
he asked .    124.6580
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack .    748.4631
Sir .    27.5096
They are waiting for him now .    516.7766
Now I ’ m going to try publicity .    394.9244
Inishboffin .    27.4279
Excuse bad writing .    480.6370
An example ?    1147.7009
He saw their speeds , backing king ’ s colours , and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds .    435.6753
Save it they can ’ t .    285.3824
Give up the moody brooding .    378.8750
Not a word more on that subject !    888.4233
Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou .    2244.5073
No use thinking of it any more .    478.4888
Didn ’ t catch me napping that wheeze .    506.9434
I said .    71.7571
Stephen , shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart , said very coldly : I am not thinking of the offence to my mother .    526.8804
Nom de Dieu !    1474.5720
All the way from Gibraltar .    312.5619
In a suddenly changed tone he added : To tell you the God ’ s truth I think you ’ re right .    611.0308
Il est irlandais .    547.6609
Hard as nails at a bargain , old Tweedy .    523.5789
His arm : Cranly ’ s arm .    249.3526
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney .    757.0822
Perhaps he was a woman .    149.2871
Her hat sank at once .    641.5901
One moment .    151.7612
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him .    861.1140
That will do , Mr Deasy said briskly .    435.8384
With envy he watched their faces : Edith , Ethel , Gerty , Lily .    539.6430
Stephen asked her .    203.0484
Buck Mulligan said .    143.3091
He walked on , waiting to be spoken to , trailing his ashplant by his side .    455.2250
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect : Is there any . . . no trouble I hope ?    579.8141
I have a letter here for the press .    276.6016
What they called nymphs , for example .    537.9717
Who knows ?    813.0843
Soft mark .    339.0975
Where is she ?    339.1984
Japhet in search of a father !    396.5656
He shook his constraint from him nervously .    818.0945
I remember .    160.3806
Yes .    27.4027
You wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you .    707.6039
Far away now past .    448.5200
The aunt thinks you killed your mother .    829.8562
Living in a bogswamp , eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust , horsedung and consumptives ’ spits .    556.7646
Inishark .    27.4249
Got a short knock .    386.9365
he asked .    124.6581
Still I will help him in his fight .    489.1513
Vain : very .    124.1442
Stamps : stickyback pictures .    455.6001
Drago ’ s shopbell ringing .    138.1943
She gazed straight before her , inhaling through her arched nostrils .    1041.1047
To the secretary of state for war , Stephen added over his shoulder .    476.6304
He ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman .    282.7392
Cleanchested .    27.4264
Rum idea : eating bits of a corpse .    444.0269
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim , rinsing empties and old man in the cellar .    676.5507
O let him !    931.1088
Bold hand .    161.9340
I get paid this morning , Stephen said .    445.0801
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen .    491.1065
He halted before Dlugacz ’ s window , staring at the hanks of sausages , polonies , black and white .    355.8117
And to think of your having to beg from these swine .    651.0787
You have two copies there .    730.3975
It wouldn ’ t pan out somehow .    408.9515
Bath a most private thing .    619.2315
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry : Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one , and Arius , warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father , and Valentine , spurning Christ ’ s terrene body , and    487.8875
the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son .    1644.4573
Ringsend : wigwams of brown steersmen and master mariners .    676.1024
I paid the rent .    294.8605
You , Cochrane , what city sent for him ?    538.0656
Ruins and tenements .    216.7607
He scrambled up by the stones , water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair , water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth .    727.9038
The coals were reddening .    924.5530
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine .    568.5955
I forget the place , sir .    228.3291
Did I not take it up ?    523.3538
My wife too , he said .    176.2389
Ferm .    27.4256
Chopsticks ?    293.6947
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him .    1072.1685
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high .    555.6224
Looked shut .    271.3123
Why Ophelia committed suicide .    1528.0592
Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him , cleft by a crooked crack .    575.3920
What then ?    458.9665
Airs romped round him , nipping and eager airs .    756.8887
Yes , she said .    58.8392
The ghostcandle to light her agony .    525.0988
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O ’ Loughlin ’ s of Blackpitts .    608.9624
I told her to come after eight .    504.5513
He added in a preacher ’ s tone : For this , O dearly beloved , is the genuine Christine : body and soul and blood and ouns .    517.1616
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay .    579.4612
Poetical idea : pink , then golden , then grey , then black .    411.2292
) , the heat .    144.4398
You just shove in my name if I ’ m not there , will you ?    585.5357
Dan Occam thought of that , invincible doctor .    484.3866
Print anything now .    343.6861
He smiled , pleasing himself .    394.9973
Mulligan said .    71.0128
Stephen , taking his ashplant from its leaningplace , followed them out and , as they went down the ladder , pulled to the slow iron door and locked it .    441.9257
For whom ?    721.5684
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur ’ s yelping .    513.6364
They are coming , waves .    254.8519
No more letters , I hope .    344.8946
He can ’ t make you out .    332.4386
I ’ ll do that , Mr Bloom said , moving to get off .    397.6038
From the liberties , out for the day .    179.8555
Electric .    27.4259
He frowned sternly on the bright air .    529.6085
Go easy .    263.2489
I see you .    116.0945
His back is like that Norwegian captain ’ s .    441.2906
England is in the hands of the jews .    119.1736
The man ’ s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears .    535.9774
O , ask me , sir .    137.7834
Lourdes cure , waters of oblivion , and the Knock apparition , statues bleeding .    370.5932
Grand is no name for it , said Buck Mulligan .    345.6142
Heigho !    225.4774
Is it some paradox ?    1272.3467
His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket .    419.9471
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you , only it ’ s injected the wrong way .    379.8467
A voice , sweettoned and sustained , called to him from the sea .    288.6535
Fading gold sky .    423.5703
Corpus : body .    161.7571
She knew at once .    435.7266
They understand what we say better than we understand them .    1254.1998
Fierce Italian with carriagewhip .    588.4601
I am an Englishman , Haines answered .    447.7069
I think you ’ ll find that ’ s right .    294.4410
Because the weight of the water , no , the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what ?    167.4772
Touch him for a quid , will you ?    302.3257
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy ?    980.5947
Fred Ryan , two shillings .    360.9478
A whirring whistle : goal .    621.4379
Why ?    294.9030
Invent a story for some proverb .    690.3525
Now I eat his salt bread .    637.0475
There is a meeting of the cattletraders ’ association today at the City Arms hotel .    554.2477
It ’ s a wonderful tale , Haines said , bringing them to halt again .    282.9913
No .    27.4028
No , I didn ’ t .    125.4824
I am caught in this burning scene .    1113.0048
For you , please ?    292.0198
He felt heavy , full : then a gentle loosening of his bowels .    500.5077
O , that ’ s all right .    91.6182
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan .    583.3909
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted .    673.9927
Are you not coming in ?    334.7074
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel .    551.4749
O , an impossible person !    792.8094
Strange kind of music that last night .    537.1054
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff , watching : businessman , boatman .    312.8928
Old Father Ocean .    445.7816
And they are the signs of a nation ’ s decay .    288.4139
He moved to go .    237.5712
I ’ m sure of that .    156.9548
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail .    966.2643
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed .    860.5426
Mind you don ’ t get one bang on the ear .    339.0697
Where ?    293.9321
In came Hoppy .    397.4855
Hunger toothache .    255.3921
What have you against me now ?    607.4161
Bought it at the governor ’ s auction .    193.9877
To ourselves . . . new paganism . . . omphalos .    94.1511
I ’ m the only one that knows what you are .    406.2276
Hallstand too full .    274.4538
Doped animals .    296.2623
General paralysis of the insane !    389.6085
Fresh air helps memory .    831.9307
Poor little Paddy Dignam , he said .    316.0446
Sure ?    294.2591
For my sake and for all our sakes .    618.5363
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it .    863.6434
No sound .    260.2477
And and and and tell us , Stephen , how is uncle Si ?    487.3871
Lettuce .    27.4237
Stephen asked .    170.8865
Give him the key too .    211.7205
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently .    595.2656
No : better not : another time .    412.2824
I didn ’ t see the paper .    177.0090
Letters on his back : <URL>    513.8696
Do you understand now ?    580.7247
Pretenders : live their lives .    558.6344
Snapshot , eh ?    265.0613
To keep it up .    276.4269
It ’ s Greek : from the Greek .    109.5560
The banknotes , blast them .    408.6860
Ikey touch that : homerule sun rising up in the northwest .    545.4067
