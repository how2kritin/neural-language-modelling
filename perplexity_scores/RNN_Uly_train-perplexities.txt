<BOS> The seas ’ ruler , he gazed southward over the bay , empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins .    60.0922
<BOS> Then , gazing over the handkerchief , he said : The bard ’ s noserag !    32.9460
<BOS> Useless to move now .    48.5316
<BOS> He stooped and gathered them .    28.8475

<BOS> After all , I should think you are able to free yourself .    85.6208
<BOS> She curtseyed and went out , followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant : Heart of my heart , were it more , More would be laid at your feet .    73.4966
<BOS> Voglio e non .    79.1325

<BOS> I ’ d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden .    65.2952
<BOS> Then he put a forkful into his mouth , chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat .    49.8447
<BOS> Loose tobaccoshreds catch fire : a flame and acrid smoke light our corner .    137.4179

<BOS> Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head .    95.7722
<BOS> A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow .    53.9755

<BOS> He creased out the letter at his side , reading it slowly as he chewed , sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth .    41.4988
<BOS> Where do they get the money ?    36.8118

<BOS> He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket , reviewing again the soldiers on parade .    64.6607
<BOS> Kind of stuff you read : in the track of the sun .    41.0451
<BOS> He crossed to the bright side , avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive .    49.0560

<BOS> They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently , Frauenzimmer : and down the shelving shore flabbily , their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand .    81.8079
<BOS> Secrets , silent , stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts : secrets weary of their tyranny : tyrants , willing to be dethroned .    69.3978
<BOS> He frowned sternly on the bright air .    33.4799
<BOS> Silk flash rich stockings white .    111.3038
<BOS> Then running round corners .    66.8055
<BOS> It ’ s not fair to tease you like that , Kinch , is it ?    24.8009

<BOS> No use thinking of it any more .    62.0711
<BOS> Fifteen multiplied by .    159.0421
<BOS> M ’ Coy nodded , picking at his moustache stubble .    62.4796
<BOS> Kinch , the loveliest mummer of them all !    58.5129
<BOS> His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop .    68.4528
<BOS> On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins , base treasure of a bog : and ever shall be .    47.1462
<BOS> Etiquette is etiquette .    54.4121

<BOS> Household slops .    63.4556
<BOS> His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect : Is there any . . . no trouble I hope ?    86.0781
<BOS> Too showy .    120.9554

<BOS> To provoke the rain .    36.9589
<BOS> Well , sir , he began .    14.6916
<BOS> He held the page aslant patiently , bending his senses and his will , his soft subject gaze at rest .    96.5716
<BOS> He walked on .    24.5798
<BOS> Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality .    52.4220
<BOS> Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength .    84.0181

<BOS> He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay .    45.7364
<BOS> The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells : et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam : the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts , a chemistry of stars .    74.2248
<BOS> Who is my neighbour ?    30.7892

<BOS> They were about him here and there , with heads still bowed in their crimson halters , waiting for it to melt in their stomachs .    57.7624
<BOS> The hens in the next garden : their droppings are very good top dressing .    97.7546
<BOS> Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice , in the mummery of their letters , wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes .    51.1707
<BOS> You just shove in my name if I ’ m not there , will you ?    31.7435
<BOS> Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses .    97.4758
<BOS> As he and others see me .    85.3169

<BOS> Time shocked rebounds , shock by shock .    103.8320
<BOS> Thalatta !    30.2107
<BOS> A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry : Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one , and Arius , warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father , and Valentine , spurning Christ ’ s terrene body , and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son .    102.7555

<BOS> I thirst .    18.3674
<BOS> Bath a most private thing .    74.7808

<BOS> I don ’ t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either .    51.8676

<BOS> And two streets off another locking it into a pyx .    87.4170
<BOS> Hooray !    29.6200
<BOS> Fed and feeding brains about me : under glowlamps , impaled , with faintly beating feelers : and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld , reluctant , shy of brightness , shifting her dragon scaly folds .    79.1587
<BOS> It ’ s Stephen , sir .    11.2305
