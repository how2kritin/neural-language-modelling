114.2535
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .    213.8434
" Yes .    24.5122
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .    281.6059
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .    56.3291
" Come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared .    83.1485
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr . Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .    96.8663
" That is a question which I hardly know how to answer .    36.9513
<UNK> back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write <UNK> .    193.9081
" She is a great deal too ill to be moved .    45.9400
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .    76.5025
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .    110.8011
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane .    117.2842
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances - - and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his <UNK> to myself .    181.5189
Are you going much farther ? "    84.1357
We passed each other several times .    251.2387
" Oh !    5.3941
An <UNK> would do me a great deal of good , I am sure .    53.3979
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long .    74.3202
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable    119.4795
of a very different <UNK> ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham's so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire .    75.7926
why is not every body as happy ? "    46.3913
In the <UNK> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said , " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . - - I assure you it    77.7904
is very refreshing after sitting so long in one <UNK> . "    463.5975
Elizabeth immediately <UNK> the livery , guessed what it meant , and <UNK> no small degree of surprise to her relations , by <UNK> them with the honour which she expected .    342.3400
Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .    91.1839
To know that she had the power of <UNK> what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as    147.9920
nothing could have <UNK> , but the state of <UNK> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only    112.9823
grieve her sister farther .    203.8684
It cannot be concealed from any one .    71.8087
Who would have thought of my meeting with - - perhaps - - a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! - - I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am    73.7496
now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .    133.9049
His complexion became pale with anger , and the <UNK> of his mind was visible in every feature .    250.2828
They found Mr . Bennet still up .    72.4542
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to Mrs . Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong <UNK> .    171.8426
Every kind of pride must <UNK> from the connection .    245.4731
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every <UNK> speech she had ever directed towards him .    710.9583
Her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " There are very few people of whom so much can be said .    127.3957
<UNK> wore a happier aspect .    4506.6274
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .    118.1653
" Our habits of expence make us too <UNK> , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . "    330.3573
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .    53.4865
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur    111.4225
.    N/A
" Oh !    5.3941
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr . Darcy's civility , and above all , of his wishing her    133.6293
to be acquainted with his sister .    30.5430
" What does Mr . Darcy mean , " said she to Charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? "    44.9499
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that <UNK> her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself .    219.1924
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .    78.0370
" My uncle is to send a servant for us . "    51.4869
And in the wretched state of his own <UNK> , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations , for it had just <UNK> that he had left <UNK> debts behind him , to a very considerable <UNK>    222.4065
.    N/A
" Yes , she did . "    13.1163
" How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr . Darcy , for now they do appear wholly <UNK> . "    119.5695
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , <UNK> at the same time the most <UNK> composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .    160.7195
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who    107.7449
sat opposite to them .    309.8280
It originated in Mrs . Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth's arm <UNK> to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .    164.8964
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of <UNK> such a <UNK> as that , it might be of essential consequence .    232.2435
It was then <UNK> in the following manner .    127.3698
" Not at all .    29.8966
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .    70.2060
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in    81.0718
their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of    122.7049
him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself .    51.4872
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .    61.1756
" I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life - - - - " Mrs . Philips was very thankful for his <UNK> , but could not    45.6574
wait for his reason .    89.8987
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .    76.6120
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .    113.6803
" Why will you think so ?    45.4387
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .    57.3369
" That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . "    26.4149
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .    98.0529
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . "    131.7694
" Oh !    5.3941
It was an earnest , <UNK> <UNK> , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .    289.2262
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .    71.3894
In the hall they parted .    55.2592
" Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .    86.3542
" I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr . Darcy has no defect .    38.6922
I am most seriously displeased . "    129.3178
That will make <UNK> with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . "    193.1345
The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ; and till the morrow , their going was <UNK> .    173.3992
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately .    47.3435
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .    99.1432
The old lady is Mrs . Jenkinson , who lives with them .    137.1291
Mrs . <UNK> respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <UNK> of her knowing her master .    333.9312
" Yet why did he come ? "    70.7569
But your arts and <UNK> may , in a moment of <UNK> , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .    165.3600
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .    71.2789
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market - town , where the family did not visit .    148.8879
I will not tell you what it is .    18.7397
" Indeed , <UNK> , you are mistaken , " said Elizabeth , <UNK> for her mother .    61.5880
He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit <UNK> long .    123.6326
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so <UNK> , to receive her and her    109.4909
husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .    33.7918
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield    87.7710
, which was fixed for the following Tuesday .    106.8523
" <UNK> , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss <UNK> as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in <UNK> library . "    198.6436
But however he did not .    76.5175
But you know married women have never much time for writing .    333.2239
" He likes to have his own way very well , " replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .    60.2898
Lord !    3.5221
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .    71.4934
<UNK> for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public <UNK> , but I wrote to Mr . Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs . <UNK> was of course removed from her charge .    142.9928
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .    56.9579
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . "    119.2335
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .    40.2933
The possibility of Mr . Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment    83.8510
was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <UNK> of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " <UNK> to Mr . Collins !    140.5467
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man    132.5244
whom he so justly <UNK> .    1737.2367
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr .    298.5390
Mrs . Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so - - but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .    66.3362
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry .    159.2050
" I am talking of <UNK> , Charles . "    107.4023
His fear of her , has always <UNK> , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of <UNK> the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . "    102.1225
He was my <UNK> , and excessively attached to me .    118.9030
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs . Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .    175.0169
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . "    136.7669
But so they always are .    175.9702
How he lived I know not .    227.6022
Darcy . - - She felt all the perverseness of the <UNK> that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite <UNK> of hers . -    168.0022
- How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! - - Yet it did , and even a third .    155.4205
The other is Miss De Bourgh .    93.8951
She was at least free from the offence of Mr . Darcy's farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .    154.0238
They will have nothing else to do . "    17.2732
The <UNK> of Rosings Park was their <UNK> on one side .    817.4990
" Dear Lizzy ! "    46.9644
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .    91.9511
A little time therefore . - - I shall certainly try to get the better . "    29.3398
" Oh !    5.3941
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .    258.7028
" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another <UNK> !    206.0051
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr . Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting <UNK> , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable    165.0443
spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings .    193.4028
" But upon my honour I do not .    89.9313
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want    60.4661
of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his <UNK> friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations .    199.0858
And now <UNK> Mr . Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?    152.4365
oh !    81.9609
Mr . Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .    87.0024
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon <UNK> behind , while her sister , <UNK> for <UNK> , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , <UNK> , what news ?    156.8613
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? "    122.6224
Mrs . Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . "    12.6753
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? "    237.5469
" <UNK> well .    1811.9746
Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London .    42.8117
They were within twenty <UNK> of each other , and so <UNK> was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .    110.9213
You must contrive to send somebody .    190.2816
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . "    74.0833
As for their mother , Mr . Collins's letter had done away much of her ill - will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .    65.5256
I thank you for <UNK> it so fully .    586.2218
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the <UNK> <UNK> her coming so far alone .    379.4324
It <UNK> me , I confess ; - - for certainly , there can be nothing so <UNK> to them as instruction .    167.7239
I should infinitely prefer a book . "    263.0863
I declare I do not know a more <UNK> object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do . "    162.4215
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of    129.8035
her .    4340.3135
Jane looked a little <UNK> than usual , but more <UNK> than Elizabeth had expected .    238.9111
" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way .    76.5317
" The first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them .    40.5432
said he ; " that is rather singular . "    59.3735
" Of whom does Jane ever think ill ?    435.9494
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she <UNK> part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her <UNK> manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected    234.3868
with him should have an understanding of the first class . "    117.3192
" His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . "    92.6837
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her .    94.9735
Its <UNK> depended on others .    3396.9697
Mr . Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .    84.5982
" These are home questions - - and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many <UNK> of that nature .    166.3129
" Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself . "    165.3087
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her - - a present from my master ; she comes here to - morrow with him . "    174.4609
" His manners are very different from his cousin's . "    72.4656
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not <UNK> till yesterday morning at eight .    911.8908
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and <UNK> .    306.7990
It was drawn at the same time as the other - - about eight years ago . "    45.0407
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .    258.3127
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over    101.3823
, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been <UNK> elsewhere .    146.9300
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .    85.9636
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before .    129.9100
" Yes , madam , " said Mrs . Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine .    25.4384
Mrs . Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .    83.0825
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this .    214.7097
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .    60.5652
But our visitor was very obstinate .    273.5162
I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice .    403.5997
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should <UNK> .    68.9984
What is your own opinion ? "    21.3794
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting !    93.0688
Mr . Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day .    82.7030
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the <UNK> he had been making , and had even    134.4950
<UNK> to suggest some herself , - - some <UNK> in the <UNK> up stairs .    738.2375
" I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton . "    33.0118
He shook his head . - - " I wish I could call her amiable .    40.0151
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .    32.3535
" I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the <UNK> and public places .    209.8493
" I never saw such a woman .    20.1409
She certainly did not hate him .    55.1278
I can hardly write for laughing .    177.0676
" We can all plague and punish one another .    730.8845
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .    72.6795
Mrs . Bennet was <UNK> in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and <UNK> in her <UNK> that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to    86.2883
; and in the <UNK> happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .    485.8288
" Is my father in town ? "    33.2824
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane .    69.4999
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .    253.7787
Her pale face and <UNK> manner made him <UNK> , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was <UNK> by Lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .    186.7816
" Oh !    5.3941
I will put on my things in a moment .    87.5141
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her <UNK> letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <UNK> over .    184.7622
<UNK> Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters    80.3346
out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead .    14.9969
<UNK> nature is so <UNK> to fall into it !    651.6782
The one <UNK> must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago .    275.0623
cried Elizabeth .    4.2699
" <UNK> with !    15625.5537
said she .    27.0139
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have <UNK> from the hint ; but she had merely intended to <UNK> Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make    155.3838
her betray a <UNK> which might injure her in Darcy's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .    266.4179
" Oh , yes ! - - that , that is the worst of all .    27.8256
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .    44.0816
Mrs . Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . - - <UNK>    112.9475
staying longer , however , Elizabeth was <UNK> resolved - - nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as <UNK> themselves <UNK> long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley's carriage immediately , and    200.2556
at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .    157.5640
Five daughters <UNK> entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs . Bennet , for many years after Lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .    82.0106
" And this is always the way with him , " she added . - - " Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .    56.3268
" I think you said she was a widow , sir ?    122.8924
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well - - and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a <UNK> young <UNK> , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall    142.8045
not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals . "    206.7785
" Take care , Lizzy ; that speech <UNK> strongly of disappointment . "    822.0361
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <UNK> .    128.8262
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were <UNK> the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin .    167.4135
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .    313.1988
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .    137.6158
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .    537.0403
" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , " said Mrs . Bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . "    42.8229
Mrs . Bennet <UNK> up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good <UNK> .    95.1998
" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ?    55.6561
<UNK> and nonsense , whims and <UNK> do <UNK> me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . - - But these , I suppose , are <UNK> what you are without . "    237.8381
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . "    17.5095
" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle .    69.1013
" With my mother up stairs .    204.0773
Lydia was <UNK> by her two eldest sisters to hold her <UNK> ; but Mr . Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <UNK> , though written    187.5185
solely for their benefit .    279.4484
" Some time or other he will be - - but it shall not be by me .    63.2873
Is this to be endured !    182.9984
" <UNK> !    4300.7827
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add .    248.3395
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns .    40.1191
Do not distress me by the idea .    102.8361
I never was .    145.3948
She is not such a simpleton .    40.3142
But no letter appeared , and she was completely <UNK> .    275.2493
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .    60.7233
Lady Catherine was <UNK> proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her .    93.0615
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends <UNK> <UNK> by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions .    237.9284
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , <UNK> decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , <UNK> and openly . "    156.1035
I know how much you dislike him . "    34.1960
my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .    35.2615
Mrs . Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and    69.0226
manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .    770.0440
I shall see her in January .    135.4945
But slyness seems the fashion .    6484.5386
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a <UNK> coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .    124.0533
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .    365.9701
About the <UNK> , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . "    396.4338
Her answer was warmly in his favour .    122.5195
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .    76.4881
<UNK> were insufficient for the <UNK> of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short <UNK> .    113.5901
But I must tell you how it went off .    47.2113
" How <UNK> we are <UNK> in ! "    792.4692
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all - - and now despise me if you dare . "    69.3098
I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not .    51.5701
The pain of separation , however , might be <UNK> on his side , by <UNK> for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him    84.3110
the happiest of men .    20.0572
They were , therefore , to go . - - Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .    37.3761
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours    159.6922
, endeavouring to make them out .    56.1374
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? - - Do not you know that Mr . Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? "    31.5496
Good girl !    97.8972
Robinson . "    2.4889
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept ,    117.0180
and what had been her mother's <UNK> name ? - - Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . - - Lady Catherine then observed , " Your father's estate is entailed on Mr . Collins , I think .    110.4670
She must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine <UNK> or satin <UNK> .    493.4854
" Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife ? "    151.0832
said she , " I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply .    48.9840
" Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .    375.8411
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .    102.8184
She related the subject of the <UNK> , the <UNK> of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .    77.5406
She longed to see Mrs . Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " Mrs . Wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast    86.4998
of being married , to Mrs . Hill and the two <UNK> .    126.1927
Mrs . Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in <UNK> beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . "    98.4705
And is it really true ?    292.7415
" Good Heaven !    159.5184
" If you believed it impossible to be true , " said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .    59.7626
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all    115.8999
.    N/A
" This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said Elizabeth .    73.0859
<UNK> are too much like <UNK> .    493.8736
" The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . "    55.8495
Jane , " cried Elizabeth , " was there a servant <UNK> to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? "    53.0742
" And what is fifty miles of good road ?    149.0409
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two    106.8969
eldest .    290.5171
Do you often dance at St .    84.0707
" Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield .    116.6438
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr .    12.8240
Mrs . Gardiner <UNK> her stupidity .    300.3345
She found that she was to receive no other answer - - and , after a short pause , added , " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? "    45.2138
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day . "    107.2195
She really looked almost wild . "    256.1343
As her <UNK> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .    1046.1273
or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? "    970.2964
I did not expect such a compliment . "    22.5576
" But why all this secrecy ?    142.1903
Mr . Bennet treated the matter differently .    150.2291
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .    109.8037
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the <UNK> , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I    85.5940
do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the <UNK> cold <UNK> in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .    193.7871
" That it ought not to be attempted .    78.2173
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ?    23.5400
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty !    192.4990
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .    38.7141
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .    107.1123
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .    51.1465
Darcy mentioned his letter .    124.2010
Not all that Mrs . Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr . Bingley .    65.0816
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? "    86.1036
" I have already told her so once , by your desire . "    55.0663
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King .    141.0408
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .    86.5957
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the <UNK> of former partiality entirely so .    441.7236
She did indeed .    133.4807
" I wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . "    36.5303
After a short pause , her companion added , " You are too generous to trifle with me .    51.4613
But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .    294.0868
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth .    81.0875
All connection between us seemed now <UNK> .    1388.7897
What do I not owe you !    303.6452
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .    55.8561
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .    82.7105
" I do not think we were speaking at all .    25.4316
" And is this all ? "    39.1960
she cried .    181.1460
She was humbled , she was grieved ; she <UNK> , though she hardly knew of what .    128.3679
<UNK> for you !    62.2290
I think she will be pleased with the <UNK> . "    51.1048
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility ,    93.3033
therefore , was most <UNK> in <UNK> Mr . Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr . Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .    138.5411
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <UNK> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were <UNK> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a <UNK> relief to them all , and especially    98.1111
to her friend .    143.8857
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and <UNK> believing there was no chance of it .    244.3825
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <UNK> letter .    120.8894
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .    150.2006
She would be in <UNK> way , you know , in that part of the house . "    52.8627
" Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . "    62.7883
The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour's t te - - t te with Mrs . Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes ,    92.0364
that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , <UNK> very <UNK> smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . - - " As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to    243.9350
say - - she could not <UNK> answer - - but she did not know of any prepossession ; - - her eldest daughter , she must just mention - - she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . "    101.5746
You supposed more than really existed .    551.1169
" Upon my word ! - - Well , that was very decided indeed - - that does seem as if - - - - but however , it may all come to nothing you know . "    58.2267
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .    86.8107
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Mr .    406.2956
" Your plan is a good one , " replied Elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it .    64.4609
" Perhaps I do .    33.6012
The officers of the - - - - shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman - like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr . Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air ,    64.3142
and walk , as they were superior to the <UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> uncle Philips , <UNK> <UNK> wine , who followed them into the room .    696.1818
Elizabeth could not refuse , though she <UNK> little pleasure in the visit .    147.5606
The colour now <UNK> into Elizabeth's cheeks in the <UNK> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was <UNK> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather    180.9439
addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " You look conscious .    172.1968
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a <UNK> abode in the family might have <UNK> .    171.0056
Mrs . Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . "    51.1413
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .    186.2434
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs . Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .    201.6039
That Mr . Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without <UNK> any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal <UNK> in town , as Mr . Bennet thought it possible they might have gone    111.5676
to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings .    96.3176
How long has she been such a favourite ? - - and pray when am I to wish you joy ? "    110.7998
" But you forget , mama , " said Elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs . Long has promised to introduce him . "    31.5733
" She looks sickly and cross . - - Yes , she will do for him very well .    71.2779
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .    115.5302
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas .    69.4107
Mr . Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding , and made no answer .    50.1681
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .    137.9240
If he did <UNK> his <UNK> , it was not till Sir William was out of sight .    174.6700
The general prejudice against Mr . Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .    92.4003
When this was done , she had a less active part to play .    108.9605
" Not so hasty , if you please .    99.1344
my dear brother , " replied Mrs . Bennet , " that is exactly what I could most wish for .    27.6809
" Oh , well !    47.0961
You know my sentiments . "    43.6066
" <UNK> so - - I thank you . "    104.9194
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .    102.2953
" And I have another favour to ask .    93.6491
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill - judged thing in the world !    68.0959
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . "    264.3476
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself .    74.8296
<UNK> , however , that this studied <UNK> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and    134.2977
the day after the next was fixed on .    79.0964
As all conversation was <UNK> at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .    114.0937
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .    285.3266
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr . Darcy might have done as well . "    54.6003
While Sir William was with them , Mr . Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <UNK> , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that    86.5526
they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book    103.8633
room , which <UNK> the road .    387.4908
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been <UNK> , nothing can be said in her    364.2398
defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill - success might perhaps <UNK> her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .    220.9061
I came to you without a doubt of my reception .    61.9432
I need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so <UNK> dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may    159.9095
feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable .    150.9563
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . "    83.4398
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention .    65.3296
Had his character been known , this could not have happened .    71.5391
" <UNK> a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , " replied Jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .    109.7859
" Yes - - the late Mr . Darcy <UNK> me the next presentation of the best living in his <UNK> .    131.6330
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .    35.4796
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .    251.2534
" Oh ! "    3.3249
" I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . "    138.2376
Bingley . - - It was an <UNK> subject , and Mrs . Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .    80.2501
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr . Darcy's regard . "    36.1613
There was no <UNK> upon such a <UNK> .    560.3421
Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and <UNK> heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .    66.9627
The rooms were <UNK> and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither <UNK> nor <UNK> fine ; with less of <UNK> , and more real elegance , than the    262.3636
furniture of Rosings .    92.9506
" I will make no promise of the kind . "    29.7966
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to    69.4243
her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .    306.4921
" I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this - - though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him - - I had supposed him to be <UNK> his fellow - creatures in general , but did not    71.8752
suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such <UNK> as this ! "    445.8112
Mr . Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .    34.6266
Oh , no . "    44.2539
You see how continually we are engaged there .    228.0767
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music .    50.9322
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .    58.4112
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration .    62.9421
" You have a house in town , I conclude ? "    33.0169
" It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he <UNK> the use of his reason .    84.4865
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault - - because I would not take the trouble of <UNK> .    70.8815
" I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth .    141.1029
No ; <UNK> had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .    172.9758
What am I to do ? "    68.3637
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? "    33.9398
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . "    70.6561
" I am afraid you do not like your pen .    34.8560
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs . Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .    220.8891
But her commendation , though <UNK> her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr . Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands .    115.6712
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .    116.5857
" It ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many <UNK> . "    47.8670
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly <UNK> to it , and that there are very few of us who do not <UNK> a feeling of self - complacency on the score of    102.6897
some <UNK> or other , real or imaginary .    575.1317
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . "    46.7435
" But not before they went to Brighton ? "    57.5956
" And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley .    72.3325
How could I be so silly as to wish it !    41.6828
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present <UNK> , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr . Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of <UNK> <UNK> , for which I have pledged myself .    175.8556
repeated Darcy <UNK> ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . "    278.9234
" Yes , indeed , " cried Mrs . Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .    37.0742
She had even learnt to <UNK> , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an <UNK> and a <UNK> to disgust and weary .    379.7062
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .    104.9883
" <UNK> at all .    389.9142
" Upon my word , " said Mrs . Gardiner , " I begin to be of your uncle's opinion .    26.7179
Bingley urged Mr . Jones's being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most <UNK> <UNK> .    346.7138
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr . Darcy , to be <UNK> his father's favourite in such a manner , - - one , whom his father had promised to provide for . - - It is impossible .    109.1574
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .    202.0217
<UNK> it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done    111.7033
any thing to deserve to lose it .    47.1727
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs . Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which <UNK> it all .    259.0167
Adieu .    17.8552
This son was to join in <UNK> off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .    237.0243
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .    130.4279
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .    146.3304
yes . - - Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley .    65.3868
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .    181.8590
The coach , therefore , took them the first <UNK> of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn .    130.3637
<UNK> haste , make haste .    448.8629
The visit was returned in due form .    300.4878
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most <UNK> and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .    207.2450
This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley .    130.9390
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . "    57.2498
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to <UNK> people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?    76.0752
Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .    173.1128
" You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? "    186.8660
And gravely glancing at Mr . Darcy , " There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with - - ' <UNK> your <UNK> to cool your <UNK> , ' - - and I shall keep mine to <UNK> my song .    227.1931
"    N/A
They descended the <UNK> , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned .    249.7466
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and <UNK> liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted    105.5088
at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .    69.8406
" These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth .    144.3393
" He is as fine a fellow , " said Mr . Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever I saw .    26.7396
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .    28.2275
And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr . Collins thus addressed her , " When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you    112.8032
have now given me ; though I am far from <UNK> you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage    138.2434
my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . "    168.0592
She answered him with cold civility .    299.3811
I must beg to return to the house . "    38.2418
Such a disappointment !    94.9908
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .    25.4118
I did not wink at you . "    91.9761
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !    89.5317
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Mr . Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely <UNK> throughout the    232.9484
whole .    4098.3291
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her <UNK> before the servants , while they waited    103.3864
at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .    162.3090
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again !    32.5853
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .    135.7215
But she is too much like her brother , - - very , very proud . - - As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .    110.5136
These were the contents : " MY DEAR <UNK> , " You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as I am <UNK> .    126.7387
said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam .    142.2669
" <UNK> with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .    264.7870
" My dearest child , " she cried , " I can think of nothing else !    31.0828
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour    119.9573
was a constant source of delight .    106.3371
" Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . "    27.9206
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .    832.6308
This room was my late master's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .    236.9176
She will be down in a moment I dare say . "    28.3382
" Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by <UNK> . "    175.9485
It was over at last however .    71.7678
said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . "    67.6354
To such perseverance in wilful self - deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he <UNK> in considering her repeated <UNK> as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a    402.0338
manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the <UNK> and <UNK> of an elegant female .    355.8429
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley .    381.4669
" This is quite shocking ! - - He deserves to be publicly <UNK> . "    114.7129
It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully <UNK> as your's seems to have been .    430.9150
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ?    212.8390
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by <UNK> not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her ,    144.1793
without any danger of seeing him .    26.7500
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money .    137.9571
They all exclaimed against such <UNK> ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr . Bennet in every endeavour    91.8479
for recovering Lydia .    565.8299
" And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? "    42.6367
Only look at her .    26.0595
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction .    99.1643
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr . Darcy they had only seen at church .    69.2835
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every <UNK> impatience .    518.8756
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <UNK> them , without actual blame on either side . "    154.6624
This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .    120.9739
But is it certain , absolutely certain ? "    231.4157
But Mrs . Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .    110.2143
" You are then resolved to have him ? "    43.7026
It is often only <UNK> of opinion , and sometimes an <UNK> boast . "    516.8635
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a <UNK> for seeing it .    78.8488
There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs . <UNK> , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .    112.3722
said Lydia <UNK> , " I am not afraid ; for though I am the youngest , <UNK> the <UNK> . "    124.7825
But if you are really <UNK> and ignorant , I must be more <UNK> .    174.3442
said she .    27.0139
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; - - the very <UNK> - <UNK> for Netherfield were got by <UNK> .    480.8811
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .    95.0870
Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was <UNK> to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might    141.5149
not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase .    166.8634
I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require . "    73.8442
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual ,    99.8596
to the <UNK> of Kitty .    377.5602
He is perfectly amiable .    51.6360
From the drawing - room they could <UNK> nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform    136.3081
them of , though it happened almost every day .    246.2814
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable    124.2281
as they were represented by common report .    233.7210
She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily <UNK> a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were <UNK> with the secrecy which had been intended .    139.3065
" Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to <UNK> her ? "    232.2636
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have <UNK> me ; - - though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . "    89.7625
" I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . Bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .    19.6160
<UNK> to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress .    93.0192
<UNK> letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .    221.2677
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy's proposals .    99.5354
" Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget .    100.3483
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .    122.9971
" <UNK> out , " said Mrs . Bennet , " that is very unlucky . "    19.4588
Her aunt asked her , <UNK> , how she liked it .    130.3490
But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done .    60.8218
" I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . "    50.3800
This was invitation enough .    239.1502
" That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before .    21.9511
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown ,    98.9826
or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs . Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; - - and from her correspondence with her sister ,    73.1862
there was still less to be learnt - - for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .    146.8238
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my <UNK> are good enough for her .    134.9812
In spite of her deeply - <UNK> dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till ,    118.7535
roused to resentment by his <UNK> language , she lost all compassion in anger .    507.6969
" My aunt , " she continued , " is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor - street . "    38.3368
Does your charge give you much trouble ?    232.0030
Mrs . Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr . Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to    49.0246
join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley's <UNK> on fine eyes .    200.3001
<UNK> as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland .    80.3026
" Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs . Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . "    50.2352
" Gracechurch - street , <UNK> . <NUMBER> .    609.5948
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , <UNK> off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the <UNK> of <UNK> , " You , who so well know my    168.8171
feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .    98.5160
Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <UNK> to be disposed of , she could    87.9732
not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .    187.4889
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain .    48.0278
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins's correspondence for any consideration .    172.7320
My faults , according to this <UNK> , are heavy indeed !    790.2372
He replied , and was again silent .    146.1109
At length , quite <UNK> by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great <UNK> and said , " How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this    139.6826
way !    96.9644
Mr . Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister's sufferings .    197.8306
The park <UNK> was still the <UNK> on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .    239.8540
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <UNK>    86.2549
of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <UNK> side .    215.0308
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued - - that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .    177.4892
" Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .    247.6832
" Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? - - At present I have not room to do them justice . "    105.9787
" How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "    98.8078
You may have drawn him in . "    78.5774
He readily agreed to it .    174.3620
accompanied by a violent <UNK> .    426.8382
She was not of so <UNK> a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less <UNK> .    292.4147
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <UNK> will ever be gratified .    89.6861
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . "    99.9771
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? "    51.6208
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to    93.4828
be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .    48.7534
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most <UNK> .    476.0169
I always had a value for him .    109.5182
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house    173.2278
.    N/A
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .    120.9599
How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .    21.0784
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .    46.6877
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley's way . "    35.8181
" Oh !    5.3941
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .    68.0697
" I am not likely to leave Kent for some time .    39.5217
I knew how it would be .    24.6632
Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .    96.3646
I can no longer help thanking you for your <UNK> kindness to my poor sister .    184.6340
" I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . "    51.3285
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a <UNK> .    164.4783
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me .    93.9361
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .    74.2862
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton .    87.3855
<UNK> haste , and come down this moment . "    93.1422
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true <UNK> will derive benefit from such as are given .    342.0359
" An easy distance do you call it ?    386.4959
" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter    95.8918
.    N/A
They were not the only objects of Mr . Collins's admiration .    55.5268
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was <UNK> with admiration was evident enough .    285.7705
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active <UNK> in her own parish , the <UNK> concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of    132.1268
the <UNK> were disposed to be <UNK> , discontented or too poor , she <UNK> forth into the village to settle their <UNK> , silence their complaints , and <UNK> them into <UNK> and <UNK> .    988.8297
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you .    134.5793
Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by <UNK> the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute    198.4281
certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father's incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match .    231.1040
" I am , " said he , with a firm voice .    37.2513
She was shewn into the breakfast - parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . - - That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by    77.3891
herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .    58.4051
or had you intended any more serious consequence ? "    670.7277
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them .    190.1053
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .    87.1177
Since her father's death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and <UNK> her education . "    205.5780
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs . Bennet's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh !    78.8185
We were married , you know , at St . <UNK> , because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish .    182.7969
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most    88.1596
<UNK> , she even shook hands with the former . - - Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .    73.6879
I must beg , therefore , to be <UNK> no farther on the subject . "    47.0825
" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . "    72.2899
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs . Bennet was <UNK> of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time .    78.9974
When the tea - things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a <UNK> to her mother's <UNK> for    139.1968
whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .    75.1543
Mrs . Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .    187.4631
" All young ladies accomplished !    461.9416
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .    148.9031
Without a governess you must have been neglected . "    58.2541
She not <UNK> stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .    146.5636
" Yes , in <UNK> with his friend . "    58.3006
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her - - indeed I rather believe he did - - I heard something about it - - but I hardly know what - - something about Mr .    107.0963
She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little <UNK> as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as    65.1683
to meet Miss Bennet .    47.1104
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? "    51.7552
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .    145.9818
And what do you think she said besides ?    119.0360
They have some of the finest woods in the country . "    45.8742
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . "    23.2258
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no <UNK> for it .    117.5428
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable .    115.7310
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .    85.7398
Mr . Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .    64.6156
A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident <UNK> them , so easily <UNK> her , that these sort of <UNK> are very frequent . "    168.1413
" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from    36.1682
objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , - - a preference    93.6656
which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . "    75.9146
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . "    69.3976
" Oh !    5.3941
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to <UNK> them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by    159.0460
asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .    64.7995
" If we thought <UNK> of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .    76.6590
You wanted me , I know , to say ' Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of <UNK> my taste ; but I always delight in <UNK> those kind of schemes , and <UNK> a person of their <UNK> contempt .    237.9910
Her enquiries after her sister were not very <UNK> answered .    426.6907
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? "    135.6430
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .    444.3231
He takes them now for people of fashion . "    312.0450
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .    191.5863
He danced only four dances !    188.6441
They could not be <UNK> by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his <UNK> report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have <UNK> it for    128.7063
Mr . Darcy .    8.1066
They have a sharp , <UNK> look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - <UNK> without fashion , which is intolerable . "    129.6487
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her's .    68.6921
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married .    35.3526
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .    77.7210
He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .    168.7705
" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? "    71.4676
Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant <UNK> to the house .    118.1006
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .    228.4043
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing .    31.4384
However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . "    123.8654
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing - room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself .    88.4862
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one's approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was <UNK> by Wickham .    144.8109
How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?    105.1727
Darcy . "    4.6842
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .    46.0536
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . Bennet , " you will wait on him of course . "    22.6171
" Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by <UNK> their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it    61.5449
<UNK> .    10.1721
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy .    84.8593
I only fear that the sort of <UNK> , to which you , I imagine , have been <UNK> , is merely <UNK> on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .    350.4798
- - A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs . Hurst began again .    123.9997
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her - - that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself    73.1959
to be right .    58.3376
* * * * * It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the    186.4472
whole of the journey .    180.8455
She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley .    58.4436
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . "    42.9785
The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : "    117.8723
My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .    383.9592
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted .    122.3629
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she    83.2580
could reply , he added , " It is above eight months .    89.3571
" Not yet , " replied Jane .    36.8100
cried Elizabeth , <UNK> up for a moment .    92.8980
" Yes , Ma'am , all . "    27.2243
Not that I care about it , though .    58.4886
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . Bennet perhaps <UNK> the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .    110.4248
Their powers of conversation were considerable .    353.1288
<UNK> my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey .    68.0114
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . "    98.2796
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs . Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .    112.5739
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .    57.9344
said Jane .    16.8257
James's ? "    19.3251
" I like her appearance , " said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas .    79.9839
Does she live near you , sir ? "    152.5193
" I never heard that it was . "    11.6313
They <UNK> him in various ways ; with <UNK> questions , ingenious <UNK> , and distant <UNK> ; but he <UNK> the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas .    470.3897
" I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .    99.0792
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ?    124.1632
cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! - - and yet how many things have happened ! "    76.5821
You need not .    105.6886
" I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment    57.4514
in occasionally <UNK> opinions which in fact are not your own . "    498.7882
I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage .    28.1455
<UNK> them next to your great uncle the judge .    1097.1270
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary .    109.3634
Have all her friends left her ? "    94.4899
Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a <UNK> of <UNK> , to make merry at her wedding . "    128.9237
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .    80.8790
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .    67.3399
But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table    99.5221
, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .    67.6096
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .    50.3010
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .    68.6972
This is my advice .    54.2037
Their sister's wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .    121.5391
DEAR SIR , The <UNK> subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to <UNK> the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by    288.1871
my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem <UNK> to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at <UNK> . - - " There , Mrs .    123.6042
" But I was embarrassed . "    46.1613
Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .    92.9698
" There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . "    64.6287
" If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . "    136.2606
<UNK> daughters married !    1115.9872
Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his <UNK> on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .    118.1889
I should say , one of her ladyship's carriages , for she has several . "    101.4947
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .    41.6559
" Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .    126.5984
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than    91.8385
as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner . "    113.7658
That is all to be forgot .    39.1265
That he should even speak to her was amazing ! - - but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !    82.0765
This cannot be !    119.5120
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .    84.6096
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .    382.7306
This is your <UNK> resolve !    2222.9780
how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would <UNK> you about to all the balls .    122.3297
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough .    180.6033
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a <UNK> from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a <UNK> voice , " Are you pleased with Kent ? "    177.4766
" She will drop the acquaintance entirely . "    186.0007
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied .    72.5429
She <UNK> bitterly of all this to her husband .    456.4716
" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said Lady Catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not <UNK> a great deal . "    43.8356
" Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility .    46.9866
<UNK> the most violent against him was Mrs . Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was <UNK> into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .    149.0165
While she spoke , an <UNK> glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .    172.9275
Good bye .    134.5926
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? "    105.3092
" But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so <UNK> , so <UNK> , so <UNK> , that it gives me very little idea .    318.4120
But Mr . Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr . Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .    52.5733
" I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .    78.8907
It was agreed to .    83.4130
" Oh , yes ! - - of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt .    32.7988
I know your disposition , Lizzy .    66.3326
" But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason .    25.7073
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !    126.3985
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .    48.0023
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too .    88.4490
When the ladies were <UNK> for the <UNK> , he said to Elizabeth , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your <UNK> .    86.5153
Is there one among the sex , who would not <UNK> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?    203.0423
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs . Collins , was a very genteel    70.8974
, pretty kind of girl .    176.1862
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who <UNK> over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for    185.6354
there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . <UNK> , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her <UNK> and <UNK> , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness    325.1066
to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .    69.2295
There can be no love in all this .    45.4822
<UNK> must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .    194.5656
The whole family in short were properly <UNK> on the occasion .    354.6319
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .    100.4499
Mrs . Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary <UNK> of <UNK> , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months    194.2827
.    N/A
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful .    407.7983
And is such a girl to be my <UNK> sister ?    197.2960
Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the <UNK> of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . - - Mr .    93.5054
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . - - That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; - - but his regard did not appear to me enough    80.8384
<UNK> for him to see her without some danger . - - Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . - - It is done , however , and it was done for the best . - - On this subject I have nothing more to    62.7590
say , no other apology to offer .    107.2326
At night she opened her heart to Jane .    209.3833
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .    64.5688
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . "    84.3936
" Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished .    209.6210
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .    67.8701
He was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect    127.0120
your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' She a beauty ! - - I should as soon call her mother a wit . '    213.9957
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh - - the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time .    78.9914
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .    247.0847
I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better .    39.8138
It will not do .    23.7595
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually    109.3016
repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .    322.5633
" My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . "    32.4834
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant <UNK> every virtue . "    123.0899
He readily assured her of his secrecy - - again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went    209.2498
away .    11.5521
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .    139.5800
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .    118.5430
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country .    31.0943
" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness .    78.2204
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . "    74.0430
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .    384.3792
Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done <UNK> .    223.7762
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .    334.0559
After <UNK> their sisters , they <UNK> displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <UNK> usually <UNK> , exclaiming , " Is not this nice ?    1228.1234
" There is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not <UNK> .    57.3159
" Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . "    61.6397
What a good joke it will be !    95.7284
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? "    103.0290
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .    257.8995
This , madam , is a faithful <UNK> of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me <UNK> of cruelty towards Mr . Wickham .    148.9765
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .    149.3813
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .    222.4084
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . "    127.1140
It is too long ago .    51.9880
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia .    84.5760
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr . Darcy - - that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had <UNK> the Netherfield ball the very next week .    91.2736
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . "    45.1422
" Undoubtedly .    235.7841
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures    105.9119
of her joy , than the first <UNK> of her disapprobation .    173.5739
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .    111.8361
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .    155.2433
But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . - - You are charmingly <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage .    156.9832
" So much the better .    67.4031
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . "    356.7166
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .    119.9829
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .    523.5575
She saw all the <UNK> of the camp ; its <UNK> <UNK> forth in <UNK> <UNK> of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and <UNK> with <UNK> ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a <UNK> , <UNK> flirting with    1111.6571
at least six officers at once .    174.6631
She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham .    117.0794
While in their <UNK> , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and    102.2006
wholly <UNK> to the family !    153.3531
I speak <UNK> .    5050.0142
What could be more natural than his asking you again ?    95.0826
As the day of his arrival drew near , " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister .    47.7044
cried Elizabeth , " I am excessively diverted .    18.2839
He <UNK> the business just as he pleases . "    269.7137
It is evident that you belong to the first <UNK> .    154.4932
I hope he will overlook it .    76.0329
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to <UNK> her mother's schemes .    97.2533
Mrs . Bennet's schemes for this day were <UNK> .    217.7568
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ! - - Your sister has been talking to me about    128.2598
him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr . Darcy's steward .    109.9464
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr . Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it .    42.1751
We had better not mention it .    80.5877
This will never do . "    23.4816
Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . - - Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment .    727.2971
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . "    39.2694
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material    306.7259
weight in confirming or <UNK> it .    956.6555
She has been allowed to <UNK> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .    153.5680
" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . Bennet , " and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman .    21.9559
The Lucases are very <UNK> people indeed , sister .    928.1960
" Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude <UNK> him , and that in spite of her being his patroness ,    76.3070
she is an <UNK> , conceited woman . "    196.9614
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a <UNK> way .    62.8060
- - " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point .    38.1194
But it must not , shall not be .    71.9411
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and <UNK> to the honour of <UNK> by an address to the King , during his <UNK> .    140.6197
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together - - and four evenings may do a great deal . "    107.0085
" I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . "    70.1174
To <UNK> assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit .    311.0255
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object .    37.0138
" This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree .    57.4927
It will save me a world of trouble and economy .    355.3593
and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till <UNK> her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence    138.6968
to young ladies who are slighted by other men .    350.5724
If , indeed , it should be so !    45.8929
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . "    60.3416
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost .    117.9737
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .    141.3255
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were <UNK> ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs . Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in    108.9330
listening to what she said , and placing a <UNK> in the proper direction before her eyes .    118.9630
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so .    220.8979
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <UNK> his real character .    153.9021
" Can you deny that you have done it ? "    33.2218
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .    60.7821
The stupidity with which he was <UNK> by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon    386.9754
that establishment were gained .    585.2761
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of <UNK> this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to <UNK> her .    291.4877
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .    210.5833
The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more .    131.2812
Your ladyship wants Mr . Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ?    238.6895
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .    76.4576
" And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? "    79.2913
Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs . Bennet by admiring Mrs . Philips's manners and politeness .    147.1066
" What will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are !    60.0408
" She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley .    53.1610
" I know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder .    88.5312
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ?    176.2117
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .    42.5468
A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any <UNK> beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration    669.5435
will excite .    1135.0808
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . "    59.2983
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . "    90.5377
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .    189.5504
" She is a most charming young lady indeed .    52.1682
" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? "    33.3626
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . "    94.7970
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re - appear at Longbourn .    139.5396
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . - - I cannot blame myself for having done thus much .    122.5558
What are we to do ! "    74.1072
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a <UNK> , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to <UNK> at his table , nor was Mrs . Hurst , who had married a man    89.5684
of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .    308.9193
" This is a wretched beginning indeed !    114.3524
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually <UNK> her authority , but stating it to be such as might be <UNK> on .    169.9434
" La !    43.7834
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . - - It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . - - She hated having visitors    116.1538
in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .    143.9411
" And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ?    90.9556
It <UNK> all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .    3693.8521
" We will be down as soon as we can , " said Jane ; " but I dare say Kitty is <UNK> than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . "    45.3404
Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr . <UNK> .    149.3153
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .    152.8775
Mrs . Reynolds could interest her on no other point .    109.0724
" Oh , yes ! - - if one could but go to Brighton !    42.1153
" Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? "    95.4335
" I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied Elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it . - - I must be in town next Saturday . "    23.0168
I have a high respect for your nerves .    118.6205
That such a consequence as this should <UNK> , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . "    175.8235
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging .    195.9676
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .    114.0263
Mr . Bingley followed his advice .    39.3634
He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire .    50.5589
I thought I should have broke my heart . "    52.2804
thought Elizabeth .    42.6180
Jane shook her head .    18.3218
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an <UNK> as she believed she was considered by the others .    95.4641
yes - - the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! - - She <UNK> and <UNK> all day long .    207.2328
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise - - all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible    125.8033
.    N/A
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .    108.1936
She saw him <UNK> at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . "    58.1956
" A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .    172.9177
" I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .    131.0632
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . "    1371.9005
" My dear sir , " replied Mr . Collins , " I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's <UNK> . "    70.1959
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr . Wickham's attentions .    109.5660
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <UNK> of <UNK> .    363.9712
<UNK> me whilst you can . "    246.6572
It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs . Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere    105.7067
trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .    81.1663
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .    120.0868
Mrs . Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete <UNK> over him , continued her triumph .    209.1372
Her ease and good spirits increased .    358.2745
" To Jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection .    46.9195
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less    242.8907
generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . - - I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened ,    152.1940
which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . - - He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .    128.1061
- - The part which I acted , is now to be explained . - - His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our <UNK> of feeling was soon discovered ; and , <UNK> sensible that no time was to be lost in <UNK>    262.7695
their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . - - We accordingly went - - and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . - - I described , and    112.9474
<UNK> them earnestly . - - But , however this <UNK> might have <UNK> or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would <UNK> have prevented the marriage , had it not been <UNK> by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your    241.2099
sister's indifference .    428.9762
A lively imagination soon settled it all .    613.3918
When is your turn to come ?    138.8132
" I am not one and twenty . "    33.5535
" I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and <UNK> a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world    51.3748
, which is always the way with her , for she has , without <UNK> , the sweetest temper I ever met with .    164.7543
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .    140.4722
She will make him a very proper wife . "    41.3810
Mrs . Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .    72.5156
" But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be <UNK> . "    91.4362
One came from her books , and the other from her <UNK> .    124.7812
<UNK> the bell , Kitty , for Hill .    123.2147
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her <UNK> from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere <UNK> of money and rank , she thought she could witness without <UNK> .    411.5758
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw - - and if he becomes really attached to me - - I believe it will be better that he should not .    68.9626
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was <UNK> on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .    190.0072
" For my own part , " she <UNK> , " I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .    60.7504
We both know that he has been <UNK> in every sense of the word .    102.2716
This part of his intelligence , though <UNK> by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less <UNK> for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so <UNK>    216.9318
by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . - - <UNK> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <UNK> to Wickham .    254.5908
It was first broken by Mrs . Annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs . Gardiner , with    117.6286
occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .    286.2260
" She is a very fine - looking woman !    103.1646
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite    369.7549
hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream .    332.4143
Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . "    124.2137
<UNK> or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me . "    225.0644
Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .    72.0679
" He did not talk to me of his own arts , " said Fitzwilliam smiling .    67.8642
And on the gentlemen's approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan't come and part us , I am determined .    167.2838
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never <UNK> enough to say before ) how much I like him .    82.4835
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet .    36.9008
Say that urgent business <UNK> us home immediately .    5325.0801
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation - - a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice ,    138.8030
and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street .    701.3550
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected .    50.9209
I have great hopes of finding him quite the <UNK> .    314.6112
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . "    62.3110
Perhaps there was some truth in this ; though I doubt whether his reserve , or <UNK> reserve , can be <UNK> for the event .    162.9692
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a <UNK> shop just over the way .    175.0766
Be so kind as to <UNK> for us to Miss Darcy .    162.6075
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! "    119.5732
Her mother only <UNK> her for being nonsensical .    1132.6160
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose <UNK> and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and    245.6599
nothing was heard of his return .    47.7528
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his <UNK> , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment <UNK> from his horse or his carriage .    156.6860
she was dying to know what could be his meaning " - - and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?    164.5664
You take delight in <UNK> me .    1446.3380
" Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? "    238.1782
Mrs . Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .    74.7940
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?    656.6340
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . "    148.3487
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .    69.3939
Elizabeth replied that it was .    56.8111
I was only <UNK> for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at .    93.2945
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . "    97.6212
Elizabeth coloured , and said - - " A little . "    35.1344
I know not what to think .    34.8205
certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with .    395.5266
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .    165.6504
cried Mrs . Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .    69.7390
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's .    104.5546
" I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself - - for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . "    107.6361
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr . Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .    76.4924
But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger <UNK> even than pride . "    129.4073
Mr .    1.0050
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's .    211.1143
" No , I should have turned in a moment . "    20.6676
Let Wickham be your man .    897.5923
" The <UNK> boast ; - - for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and <UNK> of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .    246.7869
Wickham . - - <UNK> and <UNK> to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion ,    134.3220
would be a <UNK> , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the <UNK> of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . - - But from the <UNK> of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting    188.8426
each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . - - If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings    112.4373
which may be offensive to your's , I can only say that I am sorry . - - The necessity must be obeyed - - and farther apology would be absurd . - - I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with    81.5911
others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country . - - But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . - - I had often    56.6412
seen him in love before . - - At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas's accidental information , that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of    133.0191
their marriage .    116.1930
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .    102.6521
But who was your mother ?    123.8288
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . "    19.2717
Four nieces of Mrs . Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .    142.9361
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .    73.0772
" No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .    24.7529
But , really , I know not what to say .    57.2708
" Is it possible ! "    58.5941
" My dear Madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall <UNK> myself of it as soon as possible . "    47.0429
But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication .    55.6292
They walked on , without knowing in what direction .    121.9810
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several <UNK> in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a <UNK> glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so    179.6094
full of <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have <UNK> its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .    373.6095
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " In vain have I struggled .    161.6481
But will they make you happy ? "    90.0188
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window - - she looked , - - she saw Mr . Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .    54.7508
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " Why is he so altered ?    148.9105
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr . Collins .    47.4024
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had <UNK> as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs . Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .    106.5846
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . "    75.8740
Mr . Bennet replied that he had not .    20.7943
" If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the subject .    28.2343
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival .    227.6694
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance , <UNK> with them many instructions on execution and taste .    651.9016
" I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon - making was not so <UNK> to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been <UNK>    177.7759
accordingly . "    35.5141
" But how did he account for it ? "    65.4482
" I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception .    19.6563
It is such a <UNK> to one's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .    271.1046
" That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . "    52.3317
" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .    251.4770
cried Mrs . Bennet , <UNK> her head , " then she is better off than many girls .    102.2506
Mr . Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .    71.0545
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an <UNK> smile , and said , " You mean to <UNK> me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?    93.2701
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had <UNK> to his amusement .    309.1499
" I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .    30.2690
" If it were merely a fine house <UNK> <UNK> , " said she , " I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful .    116.5673
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third <UNK> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions - - about her pleasure in being at Hunsford    202.5232
, her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . and Mrs . Collins's happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there    117.3201
too .    22211.8848
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from <UNK> to the library ; - - their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <UNK> , who said    67.0558
, " If you are looking for my master , <UNK> , he is walking towards the little copse . "    99.6698
Elizabeth immediately began playing again .    229.8217
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its <UNK> was owing .    267.9231
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . "    67.5489
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . "    31.7107
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .    514.5441
" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? "    243.4660
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .    51.7518
Good Heaven !    50.8113
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .    181.0957
" Only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .    97.8031
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been <UNK> from alarm and vexation .    161.1536
" Is he married or single ? "    200.7615
<UNK> as she had been by the <UNK> walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the <UNK> of an intercourse renewed after many years <UNK> .    116.0791
" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr .    188.4957
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time .    250.0433
Can I speak <UNK> ?    2664.4363
In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .    56.9652
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . "    45.8559
" I hope , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party    44.6342
. "    1.0279
" Can it be possible that he will marry her ? "    64.0340
He scarcely <UNK> an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs . Bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .    126.0880
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .    84.3029
His diffidence had prevented his <UNK> on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy .    238.8461
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .    50.4901
" But perhaps he may be a little <UNK> in his civilities , " replied her uncle .    82.5848
" And quite alone ?    223.0986
<UNK> calmness of temper and presence of mind !    488.0758
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . "    77.9374
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .    99.7197
Mr . <UNK> his name .    299.6120
Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . - - <UNK> of the party were now applied to .    122.3959
On the stairs were a <UNK> of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .    127.1416
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough <UNK> and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread - bare <UNK> to listen to .    491.4040
And so , you like this man's sisters too , do you ?    240.5186
She went on .    222.0196
Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge .    125.4694
for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . "    87.4756
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are .    52.2531
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? "    55.5317
The dear <UNK> rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year .    589.9264
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .    145.7218
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . "    156.8589
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .    310.4812
" Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? "    239.7283
" And you saw him frequently ? "    43.0449
" And what am I to do on the occasion ? - - It seems an hopeless business . "    83.0983
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some <UNK> , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy .    228.9862
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! - - Why should he have it more than anybody else ? "    141.3327
There are few people whom I really love , and still <UNK> of whom I think well .    182.3359
As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be    59.0958
settled too near her family .    85.6810
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re - considering events , determining <UNK> , and <UNK> herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of    302.2794
her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of <UNK> such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .    142.3269
My youngest sister has left all her friends - - has <UNK> ; - - has thrown herself into the power of - - of Mr . Wickham .    127.7101
Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter .    142.2907
" What should not you mind ? "    36.1110
" In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . "    28.7042
" But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . "    47.7599
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was <UNK> by this conversation .    192.3617
<UNK> him - - laugh at him . - - <UNK> as you are , you must know how it is to be done . "    43.2959
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <UNK> even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .    98.7490
Such a charming man ! - - so handsome !    37.8969
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .    57.3216
The <UNK> , <UNK> with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .    725.6724
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr . Darcy !    44.0493
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it    116.0676
for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .    107.9697
His character is <UNK> complete . "    468.6770
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted !    446.1208
At length however Mrs . Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long <UNK> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold <UNK> and <UNK> .    127.0848
He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .    59.0146
Mrs . Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs . Bennet and Mrs . Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces .    71.2586
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?    483.8256
" This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . "    214.5351
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .    75.0711
The children have been wanting me this half hour .    230.0686
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . - - Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life .    98.5393
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object .    81.8858
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill - natured tone that she " wished they might be happy . "    104.3954
After <UNK> it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family    101.4945
dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .    118.6785
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged .    149.6261
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .    151.4632
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . "    205.0227
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> .    120.2729
Of this she was perfectly <UNK> ; - - to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .    113.3720
is she handsome ? "    113.2955
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .    138.5224
He has also <UNK> pride , which with some <UNK> affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . "    308.8726
This Mrs . <UNK> was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .    86.9526
" Let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . "    61.8042
Dear me !    118.1644
<UNK> and pride are different things , though the words are often used <UNK> .    411.6302
" Well , and so we <UNK> at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them .    122.1590
After many pauses and many <UNK> of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help <UNK> once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley !    117.0587
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr . Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the    68.2662
two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .    199.9017
If this be the case , he deserves you .    174.4424
" Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr . Bingley to her . "    20.5662
But it was a hope shortly checked by other <UNK> , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural    125.4608
as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham .    750.6015
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .    165.7654
He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .    408.5175
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends .    91.6293
Had it been your uncle's doing , I must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .    253.7712
Mrs . Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch - street , and repeated <UNK> <UNK> at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .    184.3379
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back .    74.4410
The <UNK> in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the <UNK> feelings of early and    374.4190
unexpected prosperity .    648.1608
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the <UNK> of the early trees .    78.2319
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .    50.2892
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long <UNK> , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and <UNK> <UNK> , at the request    230.3909
of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .    83.5385
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being <UNK> dressed .    172.5051
" Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley .    66.3062
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever <UNK> .    210.3492
" My style of writing is very different from yours . "    171.4263
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .    124.8632
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .    146.3824
To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .    156.7178
" You go to Brighton ! - - I would not trust you so near it as <UNK> <UNK> for fifty pounds !    176.1011
It only shews her being deficient in something herself - - sense or feeling . "    292.8132
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman .    131.3436
Bingley will not be detained in London by them . "    45.9621
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield .    74.8925
This was very amiable , but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any <UNK> of ; - - its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr . Collins's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .    181.4864
" Nothing child , nothing .    437.1004
" We never had any governess . "    74.4262
Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining - room , which <UNK> the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .    196.0376
Mr . Bennet <UNK> his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .    173.7002
Every thing that is charming !    30.0294
" I have not the smallest objection to <UNK> them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .    22.9736
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort .    89.2177
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their <UNK> she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the <UNK> and <UNK> civility of her    179.7518
husband .    76.1110
In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .    226.7060
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight .    224.7632
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .    167.6525
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .    159.4493
<UNK> his second daughter employed in <UNK> a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " I hope Mr . Bingley will like it Lizzy . "    112.2758
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .    69.3256
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you . "    52.8919
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " Jane , I congratulate you .    52.9554
" If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .    113.1229
She had scarcely <UNK> her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her ,    121.6103
he chose to <UNK> with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .    96.1451
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by <UNK> such different feelings .    211.3819
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . - - It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to    126.3344
form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .    226.1055
But really , Ma'am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . - - The last born has as good    123.9343
a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .    120.8574
and so she asked the two <UNK> to come , but <UNK> was ill , and so <UNK> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ?    201.2326
To Mrs . Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .    141.3935
" <UNK> !    4300.7827
<UNK> different was the effect of a second perusal . - - How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? - - He declared himself to have been totally <UNK> of her    83.3335
sister's attachment ; - - and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been . - - Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . - - She felt that Jane's feelings , though <UNK> , were little displayed , and that    121.1602
there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great <UNK> .    162.7989
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very <UNK> bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .    243.8440
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the <UNK> were silent .    1458.0725
And you are never to <UNK> out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . "    83.6443
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .    89.0288
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no <UNK> in future to the impudence of an <UNK> man .    204.1558
I rather wonder now at your knowing any . "    352.7935
" I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her <UNK>    68.7186
; and if you can <UNK> it , do <UNK> the younger girls of running after the officers . - - And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady <UNK>    248.0490
. "    1.0279
said he , as he joined her .    29.6962
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .    159.5969
" Good God !    197.9911
" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? "    76.5565
" Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . "    32.2671
It was all conjecture . "    53.5369
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former .    49.8345
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .    134.4977
" From Mr . Collins !    28.8225
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his <UNK> for her as his patroness , <UNK> with a very good opinion of himself , of    143.6059
his authority as a clergyman , and his <UNK> as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and <UNK> , self - importance and humility .    317.0583
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be <UNK> ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .    116.9560
" We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs . Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . "    58.9324
They are all for what they can get .    44.8584
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . "    51.9327
" It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should . "    45.2447
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and <UNK> ; and his civilities were worn out like his information .    428.8535
" What is it you mean ? "    31.0639
How well it <UNK> .    1641.8082
" Certainly , " he replied , <UNK> his lips .    188.2676
He was received by Mrs . Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when <UNK> with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .    142.6578
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . "    25.7681
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase    189.7613
.    N/A
" Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few <UNK> larger .    103.7071
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .    84.9267
She has known him only a fortnight .    54.0737
Her mother's <UNK> , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the    134.6373
family .    23.4056
My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says .    66.0470
" My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . "    31.4239
They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good - humoured smile , " Come ,    51.3055
Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .    40.7478
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present <UNK> of good - will are highly <UNK> , and    249.8000
that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .    131.3133
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .    227.5548
" Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .    93.4510
" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into . "    105.9557
" If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . "    16.4183
" And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always <UNK> books . "    111.3437
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .    79.8104
" But people themselves <UNK> so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . "    234.7383
" Well , and what news does it bring ?    194.7647
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better .    176.5443
her liveliness had been never worse <UNK> .    804.1796
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of <UNK> intelligence .    166.4608
It would have spared her , she thought , one <UNK> night out of two .    379.8634
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs . Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .    80.5931
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .    35.3058
She had a sister married to a Mr . Philips , who had been a <UNK> to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade .    81.2073
" Oh !    5.3941
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .    181.2549
The apothecary came , and having examined his <UNK> , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts    106.6122
.    N/A
" I should like it beyond any thing ! "    44.3370
" I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power .    31.3800
" Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? "    30.9004
In the first place , she <UNK> in <UNK> the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr . Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and <UNK> , that the match might    96.7598
be broken off .    226.6885
" I am not afraid of you , " said he , <UNK> .    25.9352
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .    103.8754
no . "    226.4360
" And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ?    131.5036
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . "    245.2054
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together .    40.4061
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .    176.2497
" Upon my word , " said her Ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . - - Pray , what is your age ? "    63.9703
Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs . F . gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W . never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to    166.6564
Colonel F . who instantly taking the alarm , set off from <UNK> . intending to trace their route .    458.3839
<UNK> men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . "    163.1954
Such were the kind of lamentations <UNK> perpetually through Longbourn - house .    1559.9482
What a fine thing for our girls ! "    89.0226
" And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .    158.5205
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . - - We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . "    83.2800
" No , indeed .    17.2952
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .    91.4389
They were all astonished ; and Mr . Bennet , who could by no means wish for so <UNK> a return , immediately said , " But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here , my good sir ? - - You had better neglect your relations    124.0251
, than run the risk of offending your patroness . "    247.5929
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet <UNK> her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to    191.5253
explain their <UNK> , and perhaps announce the marriage .    385.3430
<UNK> me farther particulars .    866.1797
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .    108.8928
" It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . "    245.3151
On the following Monday , Mrs . Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn .    49.8537
" And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? "    363.4516
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr . Bingley's heart were entertained .    151.5015
I am sure my sisters must all envy me .    214.1022
They <UNK> behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other .    152.2089
Their visits to Mrs . Philips were now <UNK> of the most interesting intelligence .    162.5165
Mrs . Hurst <UNK> with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy's eyes were fixed on her .    142.4419
I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from you .    66.3456
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .    58.3751
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .    106.8369
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . "    45.9094
Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> .    289.7386
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia's marriage .    188.1991
Elizabeth would not oppose such an <UNK> - - and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by <UNK> employment the feelings which    151.4273
were divided between distress and diversion .    1285.9691
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .    103.8788
You will not find him more <UNK> spoken of by any one . "    109.0375
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .    128.4738
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .    50.4275
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . "    150.7492
If therefore she actually <UNK> in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . "    358.1930
At least , you should not remind your <UNK> of <UNK> him . "    255.6932
I dearly love a laugh . "    422.1663
He had found the law a most <UNK> study , and was now absolutely resolved on being <UNK> , if I would present him to the living in question - - of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had    135.3956
no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my <UNK> father's intentions .    223.0540
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband .    38.4970
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .    178.4507
She liked him too little to care for his approbation .    80.1762
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been <UNK> by the same authority .    207.9914
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many <UNK> , for the sake of <UNK> them . "    109.9308
And do you really love him quite well enough ?    208.0927
" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . "    58.8526
Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the <UNK> account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; - - but <UNK> them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two    189.6221
letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with <UNK> energy . - - Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner could not but be deeply affected .    106.3155
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .    64.6606
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and <UNK> , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .    192.9582
" Oh ! - - Your uncle ! - - He keeps a man - servant , does he ? - - I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .    58.9478
He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .    105.6479
I hope you have destroyed the letter .    81.0528
" I see your design , Bingley , " said his friend . - - " You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . "    56.8723
Your conduct would be quite as <UNK> on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were <UNK> your horse , a friend were to say , ' Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do    359.1273
it , you would probably not go - - and , at another word , might stay a month . "    102.7015
" You are uniformly charming ! "    60.4850
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .    69.6302
" But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? "    69.1024
I hope they will not meet at all .    31.4984
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good .    84.5719
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she <UNK> as to the greater probability of his coming there with    101.4761
his friend's permission , or being <UNK> enough to come without it .    228.1455
" <UNK> to me very often , my dear . "    80.8458
In pompous <UNK> on his side , and civil <UNK> on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton .    389.6627
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy .    74.1768
" Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay    98.3394
in Hertfordshire .    37.1311
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly <UNK> herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy .    99.3907
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness <UNK> in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and <UNK> , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .    193.6556
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of <UNK> which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise <UNK> , he took his seat at the <UNK> of the table , by her ladyship's desire    87.6820
, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . - - He <UNK> , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered    172.6232
to <UNK> whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear .    354.7427
But , Lizzy !    36.2415
" <UNK> !    4300.7749
and so extremely accomplished for her age !    403.1867
They were natural and just .    165.6180
For though <UNK> by his rank , it did not render him <UNK> ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .    207.4090
" I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . "    62.2602
My dear Jane , Mr . Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who <UNK> him ,    77.8893
cannot have a proper way of thinking .    76.1330
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles .    329.5362
I have not been in the habit of <UNK> disappointment . "    63.5276
Her performance on the piano - forte is <UNK> . "    102.9213
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .    295.1008
As for Jane , her anxiety under this <UNK> was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth's ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <UNK> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .    154.9201
Elizabeth's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !    496.8720
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that <UNK> us .    443.3070
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and <UNK> a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .    149.9035
I am sure he will be <UNK> happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the <UNK> for you . "    90.5677
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .    115.1026
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support <UNK> .    121.5927
" Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , " said Bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me .    87.4910
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though    183.4301
her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .    190.4928
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into    118.4961
engagements with each other , how can I promise to be <UNK> than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be <UNK> to resist ?    191.6811
" He must be an <UNK> , I think , " said she .    35.8026
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his <UNK> , of every thing but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs . Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs . Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the    95.2318
subject .    39.8532
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <UNK> .    67.9829
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .    60.2496
The comfort to her , of the regiment's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .    290.6841
The letter was to this effect : " MY DEAR <UNK> , " I wish you joy .    82.6393
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement .    309.6921
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . "    50.0821
" But so we all do .    111.7999
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might <UNK> his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .    124.0533
mamma , do the people here <UNK> know I am married to - day ?    371.1460
Mr . Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .    129.3471
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .    208.9358
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's <UNK> .    109.9171
The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with <UNK> <UNK> through the neighbourhood .    644.1667
I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable <UNK> , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .    127.3046
no . - - I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . "    45.0950
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; - - till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .    172.1981
" I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring .    24.1855
The adieu is <UNK> itself .    2502.9131
" Her indifferent state of health unhappily <UNK> her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the <UNK> court of its brightest <UNK> .    447.1245
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her <UNK> of quadrille in the evening .    129.5294
To Mr . Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with <UNK> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .    120.4537
" I wish it may . "    49.2485
They must have seen them together for ever . "    35.9609
" I have been used to consider poetry as the <UNK> of love , " said Darcy .    65.3719
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .    124.2678
" Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? "    172.2433
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .    150.9702
Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse - woman , walking was her only alternative .    107.0449
" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she .    51.5700
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of    114.5801
her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in <UNK> them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .    296.4038
And when her sisters <UNK> it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " Oh !    183.4640
" That is a failing indeed ! "    47.7005
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are <UNK> your time with me . "    208.0447
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .    115.6996
But I cannot - - I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .    102.4221
Mrs . Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . '    40.0990
" But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs . Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . "    33.5398
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them .    210.9322
I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest    394.8207
upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . "    249.3534
" Sometimes .    16442.9180
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene    98.4190
between Mr . Darcy and herself .    10.7667
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . "    62.6462
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very    101.7811
minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .    129.4574
" I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried .    53.8194
Lord bless me !    407.8195
No principle of either , would be <UNK> by my marriage with Mr . Darcy .    92.4105
" Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? "    169.0425
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer . "    87.8976
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their <UNK> to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would <UNK> .    233.3877
have you heard from my uncle ? "    43.5386
" If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very <UNK> diversion ,    58.7051
and perfectly <UNK> with the profession of a clergyman . - - I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <UNK> too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .    153.1267
He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .    108.8541
If it was not <UNK> for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? "    134.1070
" I see no occasion for that .    81.5049
The express was sent off directly .    178.6173
Mr . Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .    73.9930
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .    92.2433
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .    159.3713
I cannot forget the follies and <UNK> of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself .    186.7042
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy .    131.5775
" She did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . "    14.3055
We will know where we have gone - - we will recollect what we have seen .    108.7528
His countenance rather gained in <UNK> ; and he scarcely opened his lips .    357.2560
" Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent .    16.8900
<UNK> to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he <UNK> most <UNK> to his book , and would not even look at her .    102.1131
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !    236.5531
" While Mary is <UNK> her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to Mr .    117.2220
He saw Wickham , and afterwards <UNK> on seeing Lydia .    271.8716
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though ,    94.7943
when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .    146.2281
<UNK> one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have <UNK> .    125.0046
" And are they upon such terms as for her to <UNK> the real truth !    358.9305
" A man who has once been refused !    170.5633
Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .    80.9928
it is just as he <UNK> .    128.2746
Very nonsensical to come at all !    204.1061
She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee <UNK> himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? "    129.8521
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . Reynolds was of no trifling nature .    395.1377
" <UNK> in other words , you are determined to have him .    191.1745
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she    61.2024
did , she accepted him .    160.2425
" Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . "    47.0885
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs . Philips's supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .    96.5207
" Certainly , " replied Elizabeth - - " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .    24.3170
" Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling .    24.7688
" How can you contrive to write so even ? "    81.4438
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . "    88.5353
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of    161.6498
allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .    244.3403
" Yes , " replied Wickham ; - - " his estate there is a noble one .    46.9658
Mr . Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs . Bennet .    57.8675
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch - street , for the town of - - - - in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the <UNK> inn where Mr . Bennet's carriage was to    91.1342
meet them , they quickly perceived , in <UNK> of the <UNK> punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room up stairs .    251.8246
" And pray may I ask ? "    86.7359
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .    295.5676
Mrs . Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .    39.7055
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .    122.9184
" If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . "    61.2565
Jane was distressed .    33.3871
She was ashamed to think how much .    34.6965
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . "    20.2702
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .    263.1103
I am sick of them all .    29.7909
The church ought to have been my profession - - I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . "    104.3285
Elizabeth hesitated , but her <UNK> <UNK> under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .    209.4002
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and <UNK> <UNK> .    387.3424
At any rate , she cannot grow many <UNK> worse , without <UNK> us to <UNK> her up for the rest of her life . "    280.0995
And it is the more to be <UNK> , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte <UNK> me , that this <UNK> of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for    107.0514
the consolation of yourself and Mrs . Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an <UNK> , at so early an age .    67.9352
" It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .    48.0984
Her reflections were in general satisfactory .    282.1531
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . "    117.9609
" I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . "    106.9633
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for    109.1161
though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively <UNK> since the adventure of Wednesday .    354.2525
" But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy .    172.3436
The garden <UNK> to the road , the house standing in it , the <UNK> pales and the <UNK> <UNK> , every thing declared they were <UNK> .    563.8479
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to <UNK> Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .    106.0587
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman - like man - - he is a great friend of Darcy's . "    60.8338
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate .    166.3626
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas .    107.4574
Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it <UNK> hard .    447.1736
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .    75.3682
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed <UNK> away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .    178.8401
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .    290.8005
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people .    45.2624
I shall go distracted . "    87.8311
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . "    113.3350
When Mr . Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .    105.9111
" Indeed I could not .    39.3348
How are they even to be discovered ?    105.8826
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr . Darcy he <UNK> with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .    168.0655
Here consequently was an <UNK> subject of discourse .    2181.9172
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs . Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she <UNK> the <UNK> .    120.2748
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .    152.9516
<UNK> him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?    106.5285
He is gone to my father already .    89.3388
My dear Charles , what do you mean ? "    28.7231
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .    165.6216
He heard her with astonishment .    51.5651
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . "    307.2385
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest .    47.5201
It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of <UNK> interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .    528.2078
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment <UNK> her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .    144.4663
how I laughed !    427.6129
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . "    104.6118
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .    46.8245
I have by no means done .    37.2714
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves .    149.5231
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and <UNK> she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .    107.2529
how I wanted you ! "    74.6718
At that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs . Hurst and Elizabeth herself .    59.4824
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting <UNK> and wrong , and me most unhappy .    333.6746
They have at least that advantage . "    73.6473
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .    162.7117
I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte's marriage .    204.3445
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <UNK> Elizabeth !    376.7919
" It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . "    47.4949
" With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will <UNK> it . "    185.7191
Mr . Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an <UNK> .    84.2447
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a <UNK> <UNK> again . "    159.5854
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .    63.5555
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <UNK> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .    116.5102
" Yes , and I had heard it before .    22.0107
Then pray speak aloud .    1526.5924
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him .    46.1722
yes - - I understand you perfectly . "    34.0148
such an openness and gentleness in his manner . "    73.9610
He begged pardon for having displeased her .    502.2706
They came .    107.9720
I am quite well .    15.9382
" You are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! - - always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! - - If my vanity had taken a <UNK> turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it    115.0340
is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best <UNK> . "    184.2692
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . "    30.6427
Come be quick , be quick !    2286.4114
This must be the <UNK> falsehood ! "    219.3337
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .    39.3289
Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh .    69.8055
Oh !    1.4661
He <UNK> out half his words , and <UNK> the rest . "    313.6549
She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she <UNK> about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .    133.8034
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can <UNK> more than one witness of <UNK> veracity .    190.2924
my dear Charlotte , - - impossible ! "    35.7129
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , - - that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .    82.9701
She was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so <UNK> a tone , as marked her self - importance , and brought Mr . Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed    126.4340
Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented .    30.7083
My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .    78.7499
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <UNK> over to the <UNK> , who met them at the hall door .    146.1664
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy .    34.5082
Mr . Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .    230.0913
" But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . "    45.8922
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .    252.9572
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .    102.5327
But Georgiana would not join her .    109.4047
But as no such delicacy <UNK> her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill    143.9826
used .    757.7680
Not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves .    488.3677
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a <UNK> !    170.3398
The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .    200.1490
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "    140.8805
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " Now , I do insist upon    90.7230
it , that you , all of you , hold your <UNK> , and let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . "    95.1516
He had to be sure done much .    151.2461
you are a great deal too <UNK> you know , to like people in general .    137.1205
" Next time you call , " said she , " I hope we shall be more lucky . "    49.6646
" I am not going to run away , <UNK> , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . "    67.3346
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?    221.5041
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them <UNK> silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever <UNK> between them again .    241.3595
When you told Mrs . Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself - - and yet what is there so very <UNK> in    138.1918
a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <UNK> , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? "    348.8784
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not <UNK> .    106.6308
Bennet . - - They had several children .    88.2510
Mrs . Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father's life time .    64.7499
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more .    173.4832
She had high <UNK> spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle's good <UNK> and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .    168.7723
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham .    67.9076
* * * * * " Good gracious ! "    14.0382
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing - room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen    70.3460
them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .    67.5617
It is impossible for me to be impartial .    49.7598
Miss Bingley's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .    65.4633
In <UNK> her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in <UNK> her <UNK> of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was <UNK> both him and herself .    454.7948
Mr . Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .    98.6473
" I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .    89.8688
My temper I dare not vouch for . - - It is I believe too little yielding - - certainly too little for the convenience of the world .    79.2244
Very well .    48.3559
