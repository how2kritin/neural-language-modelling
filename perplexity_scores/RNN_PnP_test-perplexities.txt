84.4851
<BOS> No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; - - the very <UNK> - <UNK> for Netherfield were got by <UNK> .    498.6886
<BOS> When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .    79.8433
<BOS> Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was <UNK> to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase .    153.1783
<BOS> I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require . "    59.5596
<BOS> The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the <UNK> of Kitty .    88.8374
<BOS> He is perfectly amiable .    28.1420
<BOS> From the drawing - room they could <UNK> nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .    107.8090
<BOS> Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .    132.0522
<BOS> She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily <UNK> a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were <UNK> with the secrecy which had been intended .    123.0533
<BOS> " Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to <UNK> her ? "    142.0536
<BOS> You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have <UNK> me ; - - though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . "    82.5857
<BOS> " I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . Bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .    14.6012
<BOS> <UNK> to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress .    87.9469
<BOS> <UNK> letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .    285.7514
<BOS> It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy's proposals .    76.5971
<BOS> " Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget .    50.4466
<BOS> I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .    109.7926
<BOS> " <UNK> out , " said Mrs . Bennet , " that is very unlucky . "    16.7600
<BOS> Her aunt asked her , <UNK> , how she liked it .    84.3110
<BOS> But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done .    42.0186
<BOS> " I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . "    35.6020
<BOS> This was invitation enough .    149.3792
<BOS> " That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before .    15.2189
<BOS> Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs . Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; - - and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt - - for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .    104.5771
<BOS> I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my <UNK> are good enough for her .    110.4101
<BOS> In spite of her deeply - <UNK> dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his <UNK> language , she lost all compassion in anger .    147.3436
<BOS> " My aunt , " she continued , " is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor - street . "    29.0791
<BOS> Does your charge give you much trouble ?    207.2127
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr . Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley's <UNK> on fine eyes .    65.2134
<BOS> <UNK> as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland .    98.2398
<BOS> " Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs . Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . "    43.4995
<BOS> " Gracechurch - street , <UNK> . <NUMBER> .    313.0186
<BOS> Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , <UNK> off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the <UNK> of <UNK> , " You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .    134.7360
<BOS> Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <UNK> to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .    80.2689
<BOS> They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain .    44.1492
<BOS> Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins's correspondence for any consideration .    149.0689
<BOS> My faults , according to this <UNK> , are heavy indeed !    400.6397
<BOS> He replied , and was again silent .    69.3221
<BOS> At length , quite <UNK> by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great <UNK> and said , " How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !    109.1955
<BOS> Mr . Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister's sufferings .    122.0308
<BOS> The park <UNK> was still the <UNK> on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .    168.7693
<BOS> She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <UNK> of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <UNK> side .    100.2231
<BOS> That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued - - that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .    153.5185
<BOS> " Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .    110.5602
<BOS> " Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? - - At present I have not room to do them justice . "    77.1890
<BOS> " How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "    64.5954
<BOS> You may have drawn him in . "    64.1595
<BOS> He readily agreed to it .    61.5686
<BOS> accompanied by a violent <UNK> .    495.2343
<BOS> She was not of so <UNK> a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less <UNK> .    285.3518
<BOS> Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <UNK> will ever be gratified .    70.2068
<BOS> He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . "    85.2430
<BOS> Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? "    43.6455
<BOS> His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .    63.8653
<BOS> You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most <UNK> .    305.3336
<BOS> I always had a value for him .    64.9884
<BOS> But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .    129.5543
<BOS> They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .    104.0073
<BOS> How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .    21.2905
<BOS> Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .    31.3563
<BOS> Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley's way . "    35.9757
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .    47.8863
<BOS> " I am not likely to leave Kent for some time .    22.4328
<BOS> I knew how it would be .    12.6795
<BOS> Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .    70.4096
<BOS> I can no longer help thanking you for your <UNK> kindness to my poor sister .    118.1429
<BOS> " I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . "    39.2800
<BOS> She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a <UNK> .    121.5887
<BOS> My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me .    72.3097
<BOS> It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .    66.1423
<BOS> Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton .    76.0111
<BOS> <UNK> haste , and come down this moment . "    167.0347
<BOS> This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true <UNK> will derive benefit from such as are given .    269.4508
<BOS> " An easy distance do you call it ?    166.1096
<BOS> " I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .    68.6957
<BOS> They were not the only objects of Mr . Collins's admiration .    35.5689
<BOS> Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was <UNK> with admiration was evident enough .    269.7230
<BOS> Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active <UNK> in her own parish , the <UNK> concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of the <UNK> were disposed to be <UNK> , discontented or too poor , she <UNK> forth into the village to settle their <UNK> , silence their complaints , and <UNK> them into <UNK> and <UNK> .    314.5536
<BOS> She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you .    123.2345
<BOS> Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by <UNK> the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father's incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match .    211.3955
<BOS> " I am , " said he , with a firm voice .    21.4165
<BOS> She was shewn into the breakfast - parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . - - That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .    65.9861
<BOS> or had you intended any more serious consequence ? "    468.1733
<BOS> I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them .    155.7922
<BOS> No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .    78.3389
<BOS> Since her father's death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and <UNK> her education . "    165.4158
<BOS> A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs . Bennet's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh !    68.5289
<BOS> We were married , you know , at St . <UNK> , because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish .    159.2162
<BOS> Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most <UNK> , she even shook hands with the former . - - Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .    85.0438
<BOS> I must beg , therefore , to be <UNK> no farther on the subject . "    44.0803
<BOS> " Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . "    61.8797
<BOS> When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs . Bennet was <UNK> of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time .    76.9646
<BOS> When the tea - things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a <UNK> to her mother's <UNK> for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .    109.9163
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .    160.4766
<BOS> " All young ladies accomplished !    109.5682
<BOS> Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .    101.9278
<BOS> Without a governess you must have been neglected . "    77.5286
<BOS> She not <UNK> stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .    110.2740
<BOS> " Yes , in <UNK> with his friend . "    43.7113
<BOS> To be sure that did seem as if he admired her - - indeed I rather believe he did - - I heard something about it - - but I hardly know what - - something about Mr .    98.1987
<BOS> She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little <UNK> as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet .    54.4666
<BOS> Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? "    50.3120
<BOS> Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .    100.3541
<BOS> And what do you think she said besides ?    70.8326
<BOS> They have some of the finest woods in the country . "    39.2865
<BOS> You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . "    18.7075
<BOS> And even Mary could assure her family that she had no <UNK> for it .    98.4021
<BOS> Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable .    93.8819
<BOS> He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .    64.0903
<BOS> Mr . Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .    61.0614
<BOS> A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident <UNK> them , so easily <UNK> her , that these sort of <UNK> are very frequent . "    152.8304
<BOS> " I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , - - a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . "    52.4801
<BOS> They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . "    70.6956
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to <UNK> them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .    125.5555
<BOS> " If we thought <UNK> of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .    68.2761
<BOS> You wanted me , I know , to say ' Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of <UNK> my taste ; but I always delight in <UNK> those kind of schemes , and <UNK> a person of their <UNK> contempt .    227.9010
<BOS> Her enquiries after her sister were not very <UNK> answered .    215.1965
<BOS> Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? "    119.8030
<BOS> The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .    280.0626
<BOS> He takes them now for people of fashion . "    153.8872
<BOS> Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .    130.5854
<BOS> He danced only four dances !    68.0838
<BOS> They could not be <UNK> by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his <UNK> report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have <UNK> it for Mr . Darcy .    87.3298
<BOS> They have a sharp , <UNK> look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - <UNK> without fashion , which is intolerable . "    136.8013
<BOS> It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her's .    46.0143
<BOS> In a short time , I shall have a daughter married .    22.4418
<BOS> He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .    57.6437
<BOS> He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .    105.5908
<BOS> " Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? "    47.6886
<BOS> Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant <UNK> to the house .    92.9359
<BOS> Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .    176.5720
<BOS> When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing .    28.2258
<BOS> However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . "    136.4403
<BOS> Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing - room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself .    71.7193
<BOS> She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one's approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was <UNK> by Wickham .    129.5227
<BOS> How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?    91.4360
<BOS> Darcy . "    8.5964
<BOS> My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .    31.9518
<BOS> " As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . Bennet , " you will wait on him of course . "    17.1461
<BOS> " Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by <UNK> their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it <UNK> .    66.3587
<BOS> Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy .    100.0322
<BOS> I only fear that the sort of <UNK> , to which you , I imagine , have been <UNK> , is merely <UNK> on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .    269.5940
<BOS> - - A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs . Hurst began again .    86.7457
<BOS> The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her - - that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .    69.6945
<BOS> * * * * * It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .    125.9283
<BOS> She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley .    36.0837
<BOS> I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . "    26.7554
<BOS> The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : " My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .    159.7051
<BOS> You may imagine what I felt and how I acted .    83.6661
<BOS> He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " It is above eight months .    72.9806
<BOS> " Not yet , " replied Jane .    19.2318
<BOS> cried Elizabeth , <UNK> up for a moment .    66.6698
<BOS> " Yes , Ma'am , all . "    17.3120
<BOS> Not that I care about it , though .    43.7381
<BOS> The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . Bennet perhaps <UNK> the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .    100.2205
<BOS> Their powers of conversation were considerable .    202.4236
<BOS> <UNK> my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey .    102.7274
<BOS> My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . "    87.0929
<BOS> Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs . Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .    97.1807
<BOS> His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .    57.9917
<BOS> said Jane .    16.4570
<BOS> James's ? "    68.5250
<BOS> " I like her appearance , " said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas .    50.8066
<BOS> Does she live near you , sir ? "    101.7586
<BOS> " I never heard that it was . "    7.6465
<BOS> They <UNK> him in various ways ; with <UNK> questions , ingenious <UNK> , and distant <UNK> ; but he <UNK> the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas .    374.1818
<BOS> " I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .    74.4306
<BOS> And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ?    66.1876
<BOS> cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! - - and yet how many things have happened ! "    63.1582
<BOS> You need not .    44.5753
<BOS> " I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally <UNK> opinions which in fact are not your own . "    75.0256
<BOS> I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage .    18.7494
<BOS> <UNK> them next to your great uncle the judge .    1043.4187
<BOS> We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary .    81.3662
<BOS> Have all her friends left her ? "    78.6758
<BOS> Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a <UNK> of <UNK> , to make merry at her wedding . "    123.6981
<BOS> Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .    78.3543
<BOS> I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .    55.5217
<BOS> But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .    75.9419
<BOS> Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .    38.4714
<BOS> It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .    41.5081
<BOS> This is my advice .    32.6048
<BOS> Their sister's wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .    100.8336
<BOS> DEAR SIR , The <UNK> subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to <UNK> the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem <UNK> to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at <UNK> . - - " There , Mrs .    216.1942
<BOS> " But I was embarrassed . "    22.6286
<BOS> Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .    78.1154
<BOS> " There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . "    55.7799
<BOS> " If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . "    93.6337
<BOS> <UNK> daughters married !    1554.9851
<BOS> Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his <UNK> on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .    89.4060
<BOS> I should say , one of her ladyship's carriages , for she has several . "    64.7450
<BOS> My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .    30.4078
<BOS> " Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .    79.3320
<BOS> Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner . "    85.2408
<BOS> That is all to be forgot .    30.8410
<BOS> That he should even speak to her was amazing ! - - but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !    77.9004
<BOS> This cannot be !    44.8666
<BOS> She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .    57.7715
<BOS> But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .    225.9593
<BOS> This is your <UNK> resolve !    763.3621
<BOS> how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would <UNK> you about to all the balls .    147.3434
<BOS> Both sisters were uncomfortable enough .    141.3253
<BOS> The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a <UNK> from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a <UNK> voice , " Are you pleased with Kent ? "    156.6120
<BOS> " She will drop the acquaintance entirely . "    91.6900
<BOS> Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied .    38.7467
<BOS> She <UNK> bitterly of all this to her husband .    199.2504
<BOS> " I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said Lady Catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not <UNK> a great deal . "    36.8327
<BOS> " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility .    35.3130
<BOS> <UNK> the most violent against him was Mrs . Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was <UNK> into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .    165.4239
<BOS> While she spoke , an <UNK> glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .    153.7920
<BOS> Good bye .    73.5559
<BOS> Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? "    106.1892
<BOS> " But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so <UNK> , so <UNK> , so <UNK> , that it gives me very little idea .    244.5734
<BOS> But Mr . Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr . Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .    45.3455
<BOS> " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .    41.0091
<BOS> It was agreed to .    29.8053
<BOS> " Oh , yes ! - - of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt .    29.4563
<BOS> I know your disposition , Lizzy .    26.8536
<BOS> " But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason .    20.2492
<BOS> That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !    121.4442
<BOS> One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .    40.2411
<BOS> They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too .    43.4920
<BOS> When the ladies were <UNK> for the <UNK> , he said to Elizabeth , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your <UNK> .    76.6455
<BOS> Is there one among the sex , who would not <UNK> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?    227.6938
<BOS> In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs . Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .    63.5123
<BOS> About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who <UNK> over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . <UNK> , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her <UNK> and <UNK> , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .    184.8590
<BOS> There can be no love in all this .    31.9175
<BOS> <UNK> must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .    183.7761
<BOS> The whole family in short were properly <UNK> on the occasion .    172.8340
<BOS> My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .    71.3604
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary <UNK> of <UNK> , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months .    156.8180
<BOS> The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful .    125.2815
<BOS> And is such a girl to be my <UNK> sister ?    145.6962
<BOS> Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the <UNK> of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . - - Mr .    101.7336
<BOS> I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . - - That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; - - but his regard did not appear to me enough <UNK> for him to see her without some danger . - - Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . - - It is done , however , and it was done for the best . - - On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .    81.2026
<BOS> At night she opened her heart to Jane .    123.3952
<BOS> In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .    55.5419
<BOS> In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . "    63.1303
<BOS> " Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished .    98.6320
<BOS> The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .    52.6037
<BOS> He was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' She a beauty ! - - I should as soon call her mother a wit . '    148.0307
<BOS> Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh - - the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time .    78.1997
<BOS> Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .    126.9670
<BOS> I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better .    34.0007
<BOS> It will not do .    15.5545
<BOS> They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .    111.1048
<BOS> " My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . "    26.9525
<BOS> But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant <UNK> every virtue . "    99.4191
<BOS> He readily assured her of his secrecy - - again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away .    156.5971
<BOS> And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .    104.5206
<BOS> They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .    60.4610
<BOS> She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country .    22.5364
<BOS> " For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness .    61.0713
<BOS> I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . "    56.5371
<BOS> I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .    99.5492
<BOS> Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done <UNK> .    236.5857
<BOS> Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .    288.1578
<BOS> After <UNK> their sisters , they <UNK> displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <UNK> usually <UNK> , exclaiming , " Is not this nice ?    1278.5787
<BOS> " There is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not <UNK> .    53.3903
<BOS> " Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . "    37.6677
<BOS> What a good joke it will be !    72.5385
<BOS> Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? "    101.8404
<BOS> I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .    118.4269
<BOS> This , madam , is a faithful <UNK> of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me <UNK> of cruelty towards Mr . Wickham .    134.5109
<BOS> I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .    110.2809
<BOS> I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .    151.7504
<BOS> And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . "    86.2462
<BOS> It is too long ago .    25.8321
<BOS> The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia .    47.8060
<BOS> She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr . Darcy - - that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had <UNK> the Netherfield ball the very next week .    74.8266
<BOS> You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . "    39.4648
<BOS> " Undoubtedly .    27.9484
<BOS> But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first <UNK> of her disapprobation .    91.2849
<BOS> I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .    73.0219
<BOS> They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .    113.6444
<BOS> But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . - - You are charmingly <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage .    143.9224
<BOS> " So much the better .    21.1507
<BOS> It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . "    196.0708
<BOS> After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .    112.5941
<BOS> People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .    401.5045
<BOS> She saw all the <UNK> of the camp ; its <UNK> <UNK> forth in <UNK> <UNK> of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and <UNK> with <UNK> ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a <UNK> , <UNK> flirting with at least six officers at once .    968.0749
<BOS> She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham .    75.8796
<BOS> While in their <UNK> , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly <UNK> to the family !    127.1970
<BOS> I speak <UNK> .    400.2500
<BOS> What could be more natural than his asking you again ?    65.4043
<BOS> As the day of his arrival drew near , " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister .    43.3899
<BOS> cried Elizabeth , " I am excessively diverted .    17.4333
<BOS> He <UNK> the business just as he pleases . "    187.5675
<BOS> It is evident that you belong to the first <UNK> .    99.3523
<BOS> I hope he will overlook it .    37.4869
<BOS> Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to <UNK> her mother's schemes .    95.5026
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet's schemes for this day were <UNK> .    145.9248
<BOS> They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ! - - Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr . Darcy's steward .    88.6940
<BOS> She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr . Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it .    35.1842
<BOS> We had better not mention it .    42.4401
<BOS> This will never do . "    23.7635
<BOS> Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . - - Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment .    642.6060
<BOS> And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . "    29.6515
<BOS> He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <UNK> it .    318.6828
<BOS> She has been allowed to <UNK> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .    116.5069
<BOS> " That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . Bennet , " and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman .    16.9408
<BOS> The Lucases are very <UNK> people indeed , sister .    450.5763
<BOS> " Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude <UNK> him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an <UNK> , conceited woman . "    89.6578
<BOS> Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a <UNK> way .    62.3302
<BOS> - - " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point .    38.6143
<BOS> But it must not , shall not be .    37.3780
<BOS> Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and <UNK> to the honour of <UNK> by an address to the King , during his <UNK> .    131.5385
<BOS> Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together - - and four evenings may do a great deal . "    102.4400
<BOS> " I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . "    48.8972
<BOS> To <UNK> assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit .    233.0539
<BOS> Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object .    33.7768
<BOS> " This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree .    33.4027
<BOS> It will save me a world of trouble and economy .    157.5063
<BOS> and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till <UNK> her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .    144.2991
<BOS> If , indeed , it should be so !    31.7083
<BOS> He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . "    51.0022
<BOS> She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost .    68.0996
<BOS> Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .    86.4719
<BOS> Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were <UNK> ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs . Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a <UNK> in the proper direction before her eyes .    108.6319
<BOS> But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so .    149.8876
<BOS> But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <UNK> his real character .    121.4115
<BOS> " Can you deny that you have done it ? "    20.4155
<BOS> Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .    56.3919
<BOS> The stupidity with which he was <UNK> by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .    279.5650
<BOS> Elizabeth disdained the appearance of <UNK> this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to <UNK> her .    217.7673
<BOS> The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .    175.6923
<BOS> The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more .    89.1422
<BOS> Your ladyship wants Mr . Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ?    163.9294
<BOS> Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .    63.2583
<BOS> " And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? "    48.7831
<BOS> Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs . Bennet by admiring Mrs . Philips's manners and politeness .    100.5169
<BOS> " What will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are !    45.1194
<BOS> " She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley .    24.2876
<BOS> " I know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder .    52.4350
<BOS> And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ?    114.5973
<BOS> I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .    33.7838
<BOS> A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any <UNK> beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite .    527.4935
<BOS> I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . "    43.0313
<BOS> My aunt's intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . "    83.1490
<BOS> They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .    139.5516
<BOS> " She is a most charming young lady indeed .    24.0500
<BOS> " But what is to be done about Pemberley ? "    20.0166
<BOS> We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . "    68.7563
<BOS> After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re - appear at Longbourn .    84.9642
<BOS> To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . - - I cannot blame myself for having done thus much .    105.6805
<BOS> What are we to do ! "    53.2287
<BOS> His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a <UNK> , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to <UNK> at his table , nor was Mrs . Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .    103.2956
<BOS> " This is a wretched beginning indeed !    64.6363
<BOS> In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually <UNK> her authority , but stating it to be such as might be <UNK> on .    136.8888
<BOS> " La !    10.4410
<BOS> On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . - - It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . - - She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .    107.5649
<BOS> " And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ?    60.7389
<BOS> It <UNK> all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .    1632.7675
<BOS> " We will be down as soon as we can , " said Jane ; " but I dare say Kitty is <UNK> than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . "    43.4478
<BOS> Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr . <UNK> .    118.0381
<BOS> Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .    137.2597
<BOS> Mrs . Reynolds could interest her on no other point .    64.8372
<BOS> " Oh , yes ! - - if one could but go to Brighton !    33.1908
<BOS> " Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? "    70.3649
<BOS> " I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied Elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it . - - I must be in town next Saturday . "    18.3688
<BOS> I have a high respect for your nerves .    59.1767
<BOS> That such a consequence as this should <UNK> , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . "    157.8500
<BOS> But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging .    115.8121
<BOS> I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .    77.6604
<BOS> Mr . Bingley followed his advice .    23.3360
<BOS> He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire .    40.3442
<BOS> I thought I should have broke my heart . "    36.8331
<BOS> thought Elizabeth .    50.5264
<BOS> Jane shook her head .    15.6569
<BOS> His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an <UNK> as she believed she was considered by the others .    85.3242
<BOS> yes - - the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! - - She <UNK> and <UNK> all day long .    184.1712
<BOS> While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise - - all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .    112.5105
<BOS> Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .    86.2804
<BOS> She saw him <UNK> at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . "    48.0726
<BOS> " A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .    86.6805
<BOS> " I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .    84.7767
<BOS> Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . "    567.1011
<BOS> " My dear sir , " replied Mr . Collins , " I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's <UNK> . "    58.3625
<BOS> Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr . Wickham's attentions .    96.5526
<BOS> Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <UNK> of <UNK> .    280.2647
<BOS> <UNK> me whilst you can . "    767.3646
<BOS> It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs . Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .    97.8999
<BOS> Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .    111.4535
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete <UNK> over him , continued her triumph .    152.2852
<BOS> Her ease and good spirits increased .    132.4940
<BOS> " To Jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection .    40.5262
<BOS> But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . - - I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . - - He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . - - The part which I acted , is now to be explained . - - His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our <UNK> of feeling was soon discovered ; and , <UNK> sensible that no time was to be lost in <UNK> their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . - - We accordingly went - - and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . - - I described , and <UNK> them earnestly . - - But , however this <UNK> might have <UNK> or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would <UNK> have prevented the marriage , had it not been <UNK> by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister's indifference .    180.8197
<BOS> A lively imagination soon settled it all .    216.9041
<BOS> When is your turn to come ?    81.0360
<BOS> " I am not one and twenty . "    16.1220
<BOS> " I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and <UNK> a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without <UNK> , the sweetest temper I ever met with .    62.1105
<BOS> Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .    140.7847
<BOS> She will make him a very proper wife . "    27.3605
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .    64.1538
<BOS> " But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be <UNK> . "    72.1826
<BOS> One came from her books , and the other from her <UNK> .    118.4521
<BOS> <UNK> the bell , Kitty , for Hill .    253.1563
<BOS> She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her <UNK> from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere <UNK> of money and rank , she thought she could witness without <UNK> .    324.6980
<BOS> But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw - - and if he becomes really attached to me - - I believe it will be better that he should not .    55.8452
<BOS> She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was <UNK> on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .    156.5029
<BOS> " For my own part , " she <UNK> , " I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .    43.0420
<BOS> We both know that he has been <UNK> in every sense of the word .    82.8278
<BOS> This part of his intelligence , though <UNK> by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less <UNK> for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so <UNK> by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . - - <UNK> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <UNK> to Wickham .    227.6649
<BOS> It was first broken by Mrs . Annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs . Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .    111.7197
<BOS> " She is a very fine - looking woman !    43.9255
<BOS> They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream .    359.0674
<BOS> Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . "    116.9460
<BOS> <UNK> or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me . "    319.4477
<BOS> Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .    72.9890
<BOS> " He did not talk to me of his own arts , " said Fitzwilliam smiling .    46.0756
<BOS> And on the gentlemen's approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan't come and part us , I am determined .    150.4674
<BOS> Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never <UNK> enough to say before ) how much I like him .    76.6092
<BOS> She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet .    30.7577
<BOS> Say that urgent business <UNK> us home immediately .    3699.2563
<BOS> The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation - - a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street .    149.1528
<BOS> Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected .    43.3109
<BOS> I have great hopes of finding him quite the <UNK> .    124.2029
<BOS> But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . "    48.0761
<BOS> Perhaps there was some truth in this ; though I doubt whether his reserve , or <UNK> reserve , can be <UNK> for the event .    144.7418
<BOS> The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a <UNK> shop just over the way .    131.8610
<BOS> Be so kind as to <UNK> for us to Miss Darcy .    161.5384
<BOS> What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! "    113.8232
<BOS> Her mother only <UNK> her for being nonsensical .    479.4352
<BOS> Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose <UNK> and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .    167.9480
<BOS> Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his <UNK> , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment <UNK> from his horse or his carriage .    145.6888
<BOS> she was dying to know what could be his meaning " - - and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?    158.1555
<BOS> You take delight in <UNK> me .    527.7999
<BOS> " Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? "    156.3642
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .    60.1323
<BOS> Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?    542.4399
<BOS> Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . "    103.9498
<BOS> For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .    62.4542
<BOS> Elizabeth replied that it was .    37.9289
<BOS> I was only <UNK> for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at .    63.7449
<BOS> Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . "    98.6472
<BOS> Elizabeth coloured , and said - - " A little . "    31.2911
<BOS> I know not what to think .    21.5162
<BOS> certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with .    400.8392
<BOS> It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .    112.8639
<BOS> cried Mrs . Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .    66.9436
<BOS> I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's .    78.4702
<BOS> " I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself - - for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . "    83.5083
<BOS> When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr . Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .    66.6595
<BOS> But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger <UNK> even than pride . "    95.2754
<BOS> Mr .    24.9654
<BOS> Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's .    111.5729
<BOS> " No , I should have turned in a moment . "    15.9564
<BOS> Let Wickham be your man .    340.8738
<BOS> " The <UNK> boast ; - - for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and <UNK> of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .    216.3315
<BOS> Wickham . - - <UNK> and <UNK> to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a <UNK> , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the <UNK> of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . - - But from the <UNK> of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . - - If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's , I can only say that I am sorry . - - The necessity must be obeyed - - and farther apology would be absurd . - - I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country . - - But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . - - I had often seen him in love before . - - At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas's accidental information , that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage .    108.5417
<BOS> She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .    69.1110
<BOS> But who was your mother ?    44.9070
<BOS> I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . "    17.0535
<BOS> Four nieces of Mrs . Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .    111.0872
<BOS> When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .    65.0969
<BOS> " No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .    20.0809
<BOS> But , really , I know not what to say .    37.6489
<BOS> " Is it possible ! "    26.4347
<BOS> " My dear Madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall <UNK> myself of it as soon as possible . "    43.6918
<BOS> But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication .    46.5288
<BOS> They walked on , without knowing in what direction .    54.5506
<BOS> As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several <UNK> in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a <UNK> glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have <UNK> its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .    207.0827
<BOS> After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " In vain have I struggled .    130.3232
<BOS> But will they make you happy ? "    58.5360
<BOS> Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window - - she looked , - - she saw Mr . Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .    47.4123
<BOS> Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " Why is he so altered ?    123.8303
<BOS> The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr . Collins .    35.5587
<BOS> When Lady Catherine and her daughter had <UNK> as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs . Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .    93.8696
<BOS> She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . "    58.5159
<BOS> Mr . Bennet replied that he had not .    19.9005
<BOS> " If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the subject .    19.9435
<BOS> Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival .    89.2094
<BOS> Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance , <UNK> with them many instructions on execution and taste .    443.1029
<BOS> " I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon - making was not so <UNK> to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been <UNK> accordingly . "    164.5959
<BOS> " But how did he account for it ? "    33.9879
<BOS> " I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception .    15.1033
<BOS> It is such a <UNK> to one's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .    184.5051
<BOS> " That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . "    38.5239
<BOS> " Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .    73.0103
<BOS> cried Mrs . Bennet , <UNK> her head , " then she is better off than many girls .    85.3440
<BOS> Mr . Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .    53.8901
<BOS> Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an <UNK> smile , and said , " You mean to <UNK> me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?    82.4324
<BOS> To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had <UNK> to his amusement .    287.1048
<BOS> " I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .    23.2710
<BOS> " If it were merely a fine house <UNK> <UNK> , " said she , " I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful .    98.8868
<BOS> He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third <UNK> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions - - about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . and Mrs . Collins's happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too .    132.7653
<BOS> They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from <UNK> to the library ; - - their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <UNK> , who said , " If you are looking for my master , <UNK> , he is walking towards the little copse . "    75.8843
<BOS> Elizabeth immediately began playing again .    83.6783
<BOS> The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its <UNK> was owing .    160.4914
<BOS> But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . "    60.8737
<BOS> I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . "    25.3719
<BOS> But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .    309.3160
<BOS> " Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? "    111.4702
<BOS> Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .    30.6616
<BOS> Good Heaven !    34.7020
<BOS> He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .    141.7418
<BOS> " Only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .    70.6420
<BOS> She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been <UNK> from alarm and vexation .    123.1947
<BOS> " Is he married or single ? "    87.8718
<BOS> <UNK> as she had been by the <UNK> walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the <UNK> of an intercourse renewed after many years <UNK> .    136.3354
<BOS> " What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr .    92.5344
<BOS> Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time .    213.9001
<BOS> Can I speak <UNK> ?    1077.0811
<BOS> In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .    47.4604
<BOS> Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . "    45.0505
<BOS> " I hope , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . "    33.2892
<BOS> " Can it be possible that he will marry her ? "    28.5390
<BOS> He scarcely <UNK> an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs . Bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .    107.2245
<BOS> Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .    68.8463
<BOS> His diffidence had prevented his <UNK> on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy .    169.9570
<BOS> As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .    46.0987
<BOS> " But perhaps he may be a little <UNK> in his civilities , " replied her uncle .    52.1149
<BOS> " And quite alone ?    76.9423
<BOS> <UNK> calmness of temper and presence of mind !    812.7090
<BOS> Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . "    59.4922
<BOS> Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .    96.6101
<BOS> Mr . <UNK> his name .    136.7920
<BOS> Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . - - <UNK> of the party were now applied to .    137.6344
<BOS> On the stairs were a <UNK> of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .    103.0492
<BOS> They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough <UNK> and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread - bare <UNK> to listen to .    422.0926
<BOS> And so , you like this man's sisters too , do you ?    167.6233
<BOS> She went on .    43.5874
<BOS> Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge .    114.8907
<BOS> for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . "    75.5562
<BOS> They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are .    46.3125
<BOS> I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? "    33.8586
<BOS> The dear <UNK> rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year .    430.5028
<BOS> Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .    124.4722
<BOS> There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . "    92.0642
<BOS> But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .    230.1639
<BOS> " Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? "    146.5013
<BOS> " And you saw him frequently ? "    21.8524
<BOS> " And what am I to do on the occasion ? - - It seems an hopeless business . "    56.9137
<BOS> She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some <UNK> , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy .    184.2392
<BOS> How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! - - Why should he have it more than anybody else ? "    120.8672
<BOS> There are few people whom I really love , and still <UNK> of whom I think well .    150.9524
<BOS> As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .    58.7618
<BOS> After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re - considering events , determining <UNK> , and <UNK> herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of <UNK> such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .    204.7297
<BOS> My youngest sister has left all her friends - - has <UNK> ; - - has thrown herself into the power of - - of Mr . Wickham .    117.9910
<BOS> Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter .    104.3465
<BOS> " What should not you mind ? "    21.9726
<BOS> " In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . "    21.9711
<BOS> " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . "    30.7428
<BOS> The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was <UNK> by this conversation .    100.7203
<BOS> <UNK> him - - laugh at him . - - <UNK> as you are , you must know how it is to be done . "    66.7790
<BOS> She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <UNK> even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .    84.4146
<BOS> Such a charming man ! - - so handsome !    32.7500
<BOS> I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .    40.1184
<BOS> The <UNK> , <UNK> with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .    536.2995
<BOS> That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr . Darcy !    39.9417
<BOS> To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .    102.7543
<BOS> His character is <UNK> complete . "    239.6662
<BOS> With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted !    301.2448
<BOS> At length however Mrs . Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long <UNK> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold <UNK> and <UNK> .    135.5336
<BOS> He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .    47.1885
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs . Bennet and Mrs . Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces .    62.4618
<BOS> Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?    460.4706
<BOS> " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . "    155.6672
<BOS> My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .    64.4898
<BOS> The children have been wanting me this half hour .    123.5099
<BOS> I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . - - Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life .    78.6306
<BOS> But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object .    49.6991
<BOS> His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill - natured tone that she " wished they might be happy . "    88.0750
<BOS> After <UNK> it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .    99.6642
<BOS> She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged .    102.2058
<BOS> She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .    113.2542
<BOS> It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . "    140.6488
<BOS> He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> .    82.4371
<BOS> Of this she was perfectly <UNK> ; - - to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .    91.0079
<BOS> is she handsome ? "    112.1464
<BOS> Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .    80.8816
<BOS> He has also <UNK> pride , which with some <UNK> affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . "    292.6213
<BOS> This Mrs . <UNK> was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .    75.1895
<BOS> " Let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . "    39.7681
<BOS> Dear me !    132.4422
<BOS> <UNK> and pride are different things , though the words are often used <UNK> .    562.2191
<BOS> " Well , and so we <UNK> at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them .    90.2163
<BOS> After many pauses and many <UNK> of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help <UNK> once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley !    103.4868
<BOS> Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr . Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .    75.2084
<BOS> If this be the case , he deserves you .    89.4162
<BOS> " Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr . Bingley to her . "    17.3209
<BOS> But it was a hope shortly checked by other <UNK> , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham .    138.3259
<BOS> The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .    116.3773
<BOS> He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .    291.2396
<BOS> Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends .    71.7431
<BOS> Had it been your uncle's doing , I must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .    199.8357
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch - street , and repeated <UNK> <UNK> at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .    148.4342
<BOS> Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back .    47.6371
<BOS> The <UNK> in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the <UNK> feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .    353.8836
<BOS> The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the <UNK> of the early trees .    70.4762
<BOS> I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .    36.4854
<BOS> Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long <UNK> , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and <UNK> <UNK> , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .    142.3562
<BOS> Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being <UNK> dressed .    143.6705
<BOS> " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley .    41.5853
<BOS> But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever <UNK> .    129.1354
<BOS> " My style of writing is very different from yours . "    95.7956
<BOS> Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .    81.3103
<BOS> Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .    151.7672
<BOS> To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .    139.9596
<BOS> " You go to Brighton ! - - I would not trust you so near it as <UNK> <UNK> for fifty pounds !    155.1360
<BOS> It only shews her being deficient in something herself - - sense or feeling . "    220.2488
<BOS> I expected to find a more reasonable young woman .    58.4577
<BOS> Bingley will not be detained in London by them . "    46.7229
<BOS> With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield .    66.7707
<BOS> This was very amiable , but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any <UNK> of ; - - its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr . Collins's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .    155.6382
<BOS> " Nothing child , nothing .    103.7214
<BOS> " We never had any governess . "    36.5224
<BOS> Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining - room , which <UNK> the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .    153.8530
<BOS> Mr . Bennet <UNK> his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .    143.3142
<BOS> Every thing that is charming !    26.3347
<BOS> " I have not the smallest objection to <UNK> them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .    18.5516
<BOS> Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort .    111.2556
<BOS> At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their <UNK> she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the <UNK> and <UNK> civility of her husband .    189.5623
<BOS> In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .    113.4668
<BOS> Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight .    165.6141
<BOS> They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .    100.1097
<BOS> But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .    116.5989
<BOS> <UNK> his second daughter employed in <UNK> a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " I hope Mr . Bingley will like it Lizzy . "    172.8354
<BOS> But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .    59.0231
<BOS> Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you . "    71.2084
<BOS> Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " Jane , I congratulate you .    50.1497
<BOS> " If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .    92.3455
<BOS> She had scarcely <UNK> her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to <UNK> with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .    103.0471
<BOS> Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by <UNK> such different feelings .    181.2381
<BOS> She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . - - It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .    136.3327
<BOS> But really , Ma'am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . - - The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .    103.2164
<BOS> and so she asked the two <UNK> to come , but <UNK> was ill , and so <UNK> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ?    218.9644
<BOS> To Mrs . Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .    126.6921
<BOS> " <UNK> !    128.7533
<BOS> <UNK> different was the effect of a second perusal . - - How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? - - He declared himself to have been totally <UNK> of her sister's attachment ; - - and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been . - - Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . - - She felt that Jane's feelings , though <UNK> , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great <UNK> .    112.4596
<BOS> Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very <UNK> bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .    192.1908
<BOS> The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the <UNK> were silent .    772.5725
<BOS> And you are never to <UNK> out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . "    77.7134
<BOS> Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .    62.8443
<BOS> Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no <UNK> in future to the impudence of an <UNK> man .    195.2056
<BOS> I rather wonder now at your knowing any . "    143.5881
<BOS> " I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her <UNK> ; and if you can <UNK> it , do <UNK> the younger girls of running after the officers . - - And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady <UNK> . "    109.1898
<BOS> said he , as he joined her .    23.4188
<BOS> Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .    125.9615
<BOS> " Good God !    29.2741
<BOS> " When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? "    45.7897
<BOS> " Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . "    27.6935
<BOS> It was all conjecture . "    46.9345
<BOS> I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former .    35.0345
<BOS> No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .    138.1468
<BOS> " From Mr . Collins !    13.2243
<BOS> A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his <UNK> for her as his patroness , <UNK> with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his <UNK> as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and <UNK> , self - importance and humility .    170.0501
<BOS> With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be <UNK> ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .    96.7759
<BOS> " We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs . Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . "    49.0037
<BOS> They are all for what they can get .    38.3922
<BOS> I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . "    41.1010
<BOS> " It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should . "    34.4028
<BOS> He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and <UNK> ; and his civilities were worn out like his information .    224.0946
<BOS> " What is it you mean ? "    18.7496
<BOS> How well it <UNK> .    501.2244
<BOS> " Certainly , " he replied , <UNK> his lips .    100.5421
<BOS> He was received by Mrs . Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when <UNK> with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .    136.1759
<BOS> I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . "    21.2237
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase .    143.5448
<BOS> " Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few <UNK> larger .    86.7789
<BOS> Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .    62.7635
<BOS> She has known him only a fortnight .    37.5530
<BOS> Her mother's <UNK> , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .    99.6748
<BOS> My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says .    50.0360
<BOS> " My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . "    23.8728
<BOS> They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good - humoured smile , " Come , Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .    43.7691
<BOS> As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present <UNK> of good - will are highly <UNK> , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .    155.1696
<BOS> Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .    163.6396
<BOS> " Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .    46.0291
<BOS> " And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into . "    80.4879
<BOS> " If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . "    12.9183
<BOS> " And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always <UNK> books . "    86.7587
<BOS> This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .    60.7267
<BOS> " But people themselves <UNK> so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . "    146.4207
<BOS> " Well , and what news does it bring ?    110.6580
<BOS> My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better .    132.1319
<BOS> her liveliness had been never worse <UNK> .    720.3847
<BOS> She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of <UNK> intelligence .    89.2432
<BOS> It would have spared her , she thought , one <UNK> night out of two .    243.3580
<BOS> And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs . Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .    70.0047
<BOS> There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .    29.8617
<BOS> She had a sister married to a Mr . Philips , who had been a <UNK> to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade .    66.3443
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .    141.9370
<BOS> The apothecary came , and having examined his <UNK> , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .    82.4670
<BOS> " I should like it beyond any thing ! "    25.1076
<BOS> " I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power .    21.9971
<BOS> " Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? "    22.1364
<BOS> In the first place , she <UNK> in <UNK> the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr . Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and <UNK> , that the match might be broken off .    83.9661
<BOS> " I am not afraid of you , " said he , <UNK> .    20.3233
<BOS> I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .    81.7694
<BOS> no . "    234.7615
<BOS> " And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ?    68.6958
<BOS> You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . "    235.5970
<BOS> Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together .    33.2776
<BOS> Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .    124.2973
<BOS> " Upon my word , " said her Ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . - - Pray , what is your age ? "    49.2163
<BOS> Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs . F . gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W . never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F . who instantly taking the alarm , set off from <UNK> . intending to trace their route .    209.9152
<BOS> <UNK> men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . "    296.7837
<BOS> Such were the kind of lamentations <UNK> perpetually through Longbourn - house .    804.9523
<BOS> What a fine thing for our girls ! "    72.9051
<BOS> " And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .    94.7847
<BOS> Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . - - We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . "    93.3637
<BOS> " No , indeed .    9.4787
<BOS> She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .    69.8799
<BOS> They were all astonished ; and Mr . Bennet , who could by no means wish for so <UNK> a return , immediately said , " But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here , my good sir ? - - You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . "    109.5328
<BOS> The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet <UNK> her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their <UNK> , and perhaps announce the marriage .    194.5937
<BOS> <UNK> me farther particulars .    1337.1415
<BOS> The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .    78.8562
<BOS> " It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . "    167.6055
<BOS> On the following Monday , Mrs . Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn .    39.7593
<BOS> " And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? "    237.7698
<BOS> To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr . Bingley's heart were entertained .    130.5535
<BOS> I am sure my sisters must all envy me .    90.2305
<BOS> They <UNK> behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other .    115.8108
<BOS> Their visits to Mrs . Philips were now <UNK> of the most interesting intelligence .    139.6261
<BOS> Mrs . Hurst <UNK> with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy's eyes were fixed on her .    130.8607
<BOS> I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from you .    58.9186
<BOS> It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .    49.8514
<BOS> In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .    94.0165
<BOS> As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . "    42.2538
<BOS> Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> .    188.3648
<BOS> But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia's marriage .    137.7032
<BOS> Elizabeth would not oppose such an <UNK> - - and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by <UNK> employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .    176.4431
<BOS> Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .    83.9263
<BOS> You will not find him more <UNK> spoken of by any one . "    91.0458
<BOS> He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .    106.2751
<BOS> The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .    34.7403
<BOS> Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . "    130.8185
<BOS> If therefore she actually <UNK> in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . "    275.3512
<BOS> At least , you should not remind your <UNK> of <UNK> him . "    253.3523
<BOS> I dearly love a laugh . "    143.8846
<BOS> He had found the law a most <UNK> study , and was now absolutely resolved on being <UNK> , if I would present him to the living in question - - of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my <UNK> father's intentions .    148.8957
<BOS> Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband .    29.5209
<BOS> She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .    129.3901
<BOS> She liked him too little to care for his approbation .    51.3920
<BOS> " Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been <UNK> by the same authority .    158.5139
<BOS> Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many <UNK> , for the sake of <UNK> them . "    107.7730
<BOS> And do you really love him quite well enough ?    104.5563
<BOS> " I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . "    36.5995
<BOS> Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the <UNK> account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; - - but <UNK> them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with <UNK> energy . - - Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner could not but be deeply affected .    137.6963
<BOS> On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .    50.7770
<BOS> They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and <UNK> , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .    156.6072
<BOS> " Oh ! - - Your uncle ! - - He keeps a man - servant , does he ? - - I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .    46.8998
<BOS> He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .    80.4839
<BOS> I hope you have destroyed the letter .    51.5143
<BOS> " I see your design , Bingley , " said his friend . - - " You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . "    48.2725
<BOS> Your conduct would be quite as <UNK> on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were <UNK> your horse , a friend were to say , ' Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go - - and , at another word , might stay a month . "    201.3871
<BOS> " You are uniformly charming ! "    27.3770
<BOS> It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .    52.6877
<BOS> " But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? "    56.8115
<BOS> I hope they will not meet at all .    20.9016
<BOS> But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good .    58.9438
<BOS> Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she <UNK> as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission , or being <UNK> enough to come without it .    99.1954
<BOS> " <UNK> to me very often , my dear . "    43.2700
<BOS> In pompous <UNK> on his side , and civil <UNK> on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton .    306.3069
<BOS> It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy .    55.6852
<BOS> " Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire .    72.9419
<BOS> In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly <UNK> herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy .    88.0228
<BOS> Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness <UNK> in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and <UNK> , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .    183.9694
<BOS> The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of <UNK> which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise <UNK> , he took his seat at the <UNK> of the table , by her ladyship's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . - - He <UNK> , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to <UNK> whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear .    132.8624
<BOS> But , Lizzy !    18.6293
<BOS> " <UNK> !    128.7532
<BOS> and so extremely accomplished for her age !    280.3277
<BOS> They were natural and just .    83.5476
<BOS> For though <UNK> by his rank , it did not render him <UNK> ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .    209.0408
<BOS> " I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . "    49.8898
<BOS> My dear Jane , Mr . Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who <UNK> him , cannot have a proper way of thinking .    68.8080
<BOS> The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles .    150.1302
<BOS> I have not been in the habit of <UNK> disappointment . "    39.3696
<BOS> Her performance on the piano - forte is <UNK> . "    80.2813
<BOS> She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .    164.3464
<BOS> As for Jane , her anxiety under this <UNK> was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth's ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <UNK> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .    137.7512
<BOS> Elizabeth's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !    324.0111
<BOS> It is very often nothing but our own vanity that <UNK> us .    278.1446
<BOS> Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and <UNK> a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .    165.4602
<BOS> I am sure he will be <UNK> happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the <UNK> for you . "    82.5005
<BOS> He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .    82.0928
<BOS> He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support <UNK> .    96.3009
<BOS> " Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , " said Bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me .    65.1399
<BOS> She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .    139.0632
<BOS> In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be <UNK> than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be <UNK> to resist ?    142.1780
<BOS> " He must be an <UNK> , I think , " said she .    24.0108
<BOS> They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his <UNK> , of every thing but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs . Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs . Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject .    77.1115
<BOS> The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <UNK> .    43.4904
<BOS> She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .    47.8672
<BOS> The comfort to her , of the regiment's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .    165.4236
<BOS> The letter was to this effect : " MY DEAR <UNK> , " I wish you joy .    62.5503
<BOS> Miss Bennet still looked all amazement .    110.7976
<BOS> But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . "    46.1596
<BOS> " But so we all do .    51.6965
<BOS> Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might <UNK> his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .    89.6492
<BOS> mamma , do the people here <UNK> know I am married to - day ?    393.5328
<BOS> Mr . Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .    94.6684
<BOS> He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .    172.2372
<BOS> Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's <UNK> .    114.6836
<BOS> The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with <UNK> <UNK> through the neighbourhood .    394.1698
<BOS> I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable <UNK> , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .    99.4426
<BOS> no . - - I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . "    59.8529
<BOS> Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; - - till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .    169.2966
<BOS> " I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring .    18.3395
<BOS> The adieu is <UNK> itself .    695.6519
<BOS> " Her indifferent state of health unhappily <UNK> her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the <UNK> court of its brightest <UNK> .    321.8309
<BOS> She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her <UNK> of quadrille in the evening .    104.8702
<BOS> To Mr . Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with <UNK> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .    100.5229
<BOS> " I wish it may . "    21.5275
<BOS> They must have seen them together for ever . "    23.1213
<BOS> " I have been used to consider poetry as the <UNK> of love , " said Darcy .    45.0285
<BOS> Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .    113.9867
<BOS> " Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? "    85.3045
<BOS> Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .    112.8809
<BOS> Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse - woman , walking was her only alternative .    101.5636
<BOS> " It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she .    30.6727
<BOS> It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in <UNK> them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .    146.7261
<BOS> And when her sisters <UNK> it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " Oh !    151.2195
<BOS> " That is a failing indeed ! "    29.2971
<BOS> You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are <UNK> your time with me . "    187.5820
<BOS> He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .    64.7622
<BOS> But I cannot - - I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .    90.0483
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . '    29.8801
<BOS> " But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs . Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . "    26.8899
<BOS> Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them .    181.0987
<BOS> I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . "    329.1148
<BOS> " Sometimes .    78.1180
<BOS> Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr . Darcy and herself .    69.9243
<BOS> But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . "    50.8656
<BOS> Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .    97.3434
<BOS> " I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried .    33.3221
<BOS> Lord bless me !    175.5072
<BOS> No principle of either , would be <UNK> by my marriage with Mr . Darcy .    79.9358
<BOS> " Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? "    63.1090
<BOS> You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer . "    58.3303
<BOS> He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their <UNK> to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would <UNK> .    199.2052
<BOS> have you heard from my uncle ? "    58.0454
<BOS> " If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very <UNK> diversion , and perfectly <UNK> with the profession of a clergyman . - - I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <UNK> too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .    78.5319
<BOS> He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .    78.2380
<BOS> If it was not <UNK> for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? "    118.5652
<BOS> " I see no occasion for that .    28.4551
<BOS> The express was sent off directly .    71.1499
<BOS> Mr . Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .    46.1535
<BOS> Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .    55.7559
<BOS> There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .    130.8557
<BOS> I cannot forget the follies and <UNK> of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself .    119.8321
<BOS> Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy .    114.5223
<BOS> " She did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . "    12.0471
<BOS> We will know where we have gone - - we will recollect what we have seen .    77.5570
<BOS> His countenance rather gained in <UNK> ; and he scarcely opened his lips .    208.0431
<BOS> " Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent .    12.4056
<BOS> <UNK> to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he <UNK> most <UNK> to his book , and would not even look at her .    119.2820
<BOS> How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !    195.1728
<BOS> " While Mary is <UNK> her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to Mr .    98.0659
<BOS> He saw Wickham , and afterwards <UNK> on seeing Lydia .    148.6519
<BOS> Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .    104.5148
<BOS> <UNK> one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have <UNK> .    220.9049
<BOS> " And are they upon such terms as for her to <UNK> the real truth !    240.2045
<BOS> " A man who has once been refused !    66.1018
<BOS> Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .    74.8591
<BOS> it is just as he <UNK> .    106.2661
<BOS> Very nonsensical to come at all !    121.4663
<BOS> She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee <UNK> himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? "    111.8785
<BOS> The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . Reynolds was of no trifling nature .    193.6361
<BOS> " <UNK> in other words , you are determined to have him .    91.3669
<BOS> When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .    53.9587
<BOS> " Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . "    34.4054
<BOS> There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs . Philips's supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .    73.6361
<BOS> " Certainly , " replied Elizabeth - - " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .    19.9939
<BOS> " Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling .    16.4405
<BOS> " How can you contrive to write so even ? "    36.4908
<BOS> that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . "    104.1911
<BOS> All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .    155.7071
<BOS> " Yes , " replied Wickham ; - - " his estate there is a noble one .    36.4401
<BOS> Mr . Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs . Bennet .    43.9909
<BOS> It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch - street , for the town of - - - - in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the <UNK> inn where Mr . Bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in <UNK> of the <UNK> punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room up stairs .    118.9228
<BOS> " And pray may I ask ? "    36.7214
<BOS> Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .    212.6033
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .    33.5406
<BOS> She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .    67.9632
<BOS> " If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . "    39.0621
<BOS> Jane was distressed .    27.8043
<BOS> She was ashamed to think how much .    20.9485
<BOS> He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . "    17.9675
<BOS> He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .    174.4931
<BOS> I am sick of them all .    16.8579
<BOS> The church ought to have been my profession - - I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . "    92.3753
<BOS> Elizabeth hesitated , but her <UNK> <UNK> under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .    184.6545
<BOS> With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and <UNK> <UNK> .    340.1692
<BOS> At any rate , she cannot grow many <UNK> worse , without <UNK> us to <UNK> her up for the rest of her life . "    244.4449
<BOS> And it is the more to be <UNK> , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte <UNK> me , that this <UNK> of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs . Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an <UNK> , at so early an age .    93.0861
<BOS> " It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .    32.6525
<BOS> Her reflections were in general satisfactory .    104.5947
<BOS> Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . "    128.2864
<BOS> " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . "    96.6856
<BOS> He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively <UNK> since the adventure of Wednesday .    135.9661
<BOS> " But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy .    86.4881
<BOS> The garden <UNK> to the road , the house standing in it , the <UNK> pales and the <UNK> <UNK> , every thing declared they were <UNK> .    465.1100
<BOS> The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to <UNK> Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .    90.0097
<BOS> Their brother is a pleasant gentleman - like man - - he is a great friend of Darcy's . "    43.5314
<BOS> That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate .    151.3491
<BOS> You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas .    78.8221
<BOS> Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it <UNK> hard .    353.4202
<BOS> I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .    54.6763
<BOS> Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed <UNK> away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .    148.4449
<BOS> Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .    236.8662
<BOS> You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people .    37.3587
<BOS> I shall go distracted . "    44.2950
<BOS> I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . "    74.6886
<BOS> When Mr . Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .    88.6210
<BOS> " Indeed I could not .    17.1731
<BOS> How are they even to be discovered ?    85.9749
<BOS> At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr . Darcy he <UNK> with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .    168.5973
<BOS> Here consequently was an <UNK> subject of discourse .    1073.8635
<BOS> They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs . Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she <UNK> the <UNK> .    99.4788
<BOS> She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .    107.6161
<BOS> <UNK> him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?    138.6096
<BOS> He is gone to my father already .    60.3272
<BOS> My dear Charles , what do you mean ? "    20.2115
<BOS> Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .    154.7448
<BOS> He heard her with astonishment .    30.8315
<BOS> Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . "    283.2493
<BOS> Yet , indeed , I am in earnest .    38.9034
<BOS> It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of <UNK> interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .    441.0074
<BOS> His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment <UNK> her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .    131.3698
<BOS> how I laughed !    177.6754
<BOS> She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . "    63.8858
<BOS> Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .    45.0273
<BOS> I have by no means done .    20.9698
<BOS> How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves .    132.9155
<BOS> When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and <UNK> she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .    96.8297
<BOS> how I wanted you ! "    78.0232
<BOS> At that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs . Hurst and Elizabeth herself .    54.0548
<BOS> By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting <UNK> and wrong , and me most unhappy .    277.8077
<BOS> They have at least that advantage . "    52.5529
<BOS> Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .    158.2444
<BOS> I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte's marriage .    144.0580
<BOS> Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <UNK> Elizabeth !    331.9145
<BOS> " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . "    36.6040
<BOS> " With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will <UNK> it . "    175.6317
<BOS> Mr . Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an <UNK> .    64.4860
<BOS> But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a <UNK> <UNK> again . "    163.7428
<BOS> But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .    49.3964
<BOS> It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <UNK> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .    119.2158
<BOS> " Yes , and I had heard it before .    13.6814
<BOS> Then pray speak aloud .    216.4286
<BOS> If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him .    34.4495
<BOS> yes - - I understand you perfectly . "    33.0467
<BOS> such an openness and gentleness in his manner . "    102.6177
<BOS> He begged pardon for having displeased her .    128.5834
<BOS> They came .    40.9780
<BOS> I am quite well .    9.6275
<BOS> " You are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! - - always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! - - If my vanity had taken a <UNK> turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best <UNK> . "    108.6717
<BOS> I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . "    25.6300
<BOS> Come be quick , be quick !    1147.7305
<BOS> This must be the <UNK> falsehood ! "    135.4354
<BOS> I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .    24.4227
<BOS> Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh .    53.5483
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> He <UNK> out half his words , and <UNK> the rest . "    252.7280
<BOS> She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she <UNK> about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .    112.6903
<BOS> Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can <UNK> more than one witness of <UNK> veracity .    206.8490
<BOS> my dear Charlotte , - - impossible ! "    37.8361
<BOS> But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , - - that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .    72.6777
<BOS> She was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so <UNK> a tone , as marked her self - importance , and brought Mr . Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented .    94.9847
<BOS> My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .    68.7424
<BOS> When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <UNK> over to the <UNK> , who met them at the hall door .    130.6304
<BOS> Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy .    22.1859
<BOS> Mr . Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .    195.6187
<BOS> " But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . "    34.9380
<BOS> There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .    207.8660
<BOS> When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .    68.1649
<BOS> But Georgiana would not join her .    42.6252
<BOS> But as no such delicacy <UNK> her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used .    114.2760
<BOS> Not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves .    250.1837
<BOS> Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a <UNK> !    133.8166
<BOS> The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .    166.0974
<BOS> For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "    137.6254
<BOS> She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your <UNK> , and let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . "    74.6632
<BOS> He had to be sure done much .    77.9477
<BOS> you are a great deal too <UNK> you know , to like people in general .    137.8460
<BOS> " Next time you call , " said she , " I hope we shall be more lucky . "    30.8668
<BOS> " I am not going to run away , <UNK> , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . "    54.0696
<BOS> What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?    142.5956
<BOS> Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them <UNK> silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever <UNK> between them again .    215.4666
<BOS> When you told Mrs . Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself - - and yet what is there so very <UNK> in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <UNK> , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? "    174.9105
<BOS> He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not <UNK> .    75.4797
<BOS> Bennet . - - They had several children .    81.5163
<BOS> Mrs . Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father's life time .    50.4178
<BOS> As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more .    138.6611
<BOS> She had high <UNK> spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle's good <UNK> and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .    152.4109
<BOS> However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham .    63.6425
<BOS> * * * * * " Good gracious ! "    16.1145
<BOS> When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing - room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .    67.1966
<BOS> It is impossible for me to be impartial .    26.9205
<BOS> Miss Bingley's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .    46.0005
<BOS> In <UNK> her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in <UNK> her <UNK> of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was <UNK> both him and herself .    423.6993
<BOS> Mr . Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .    57.9425
<BOS> " I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .    46.1889
<BOS> My temper I dare not vouch for . - - It is I believe too little yielding - - certainly too little for the convenience of the world .    71.9899
<BOS> Very well .    41.1026
