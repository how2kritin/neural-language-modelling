29.0294
<BOS> The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .    27.8840
<BOS> Lady Catherine ' s great attentions to Mrs .    10.4478
<BOS> Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . " " You observed it , Mr . Darcy , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley ; " and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition . " " Certainly not . " " To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! what could she mean by it ?    19.3893
<BOS> It was really a very handsome thought .    36.7649
<BOS> Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .    33.9376
<BOS> He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish . " " No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose .    14.8362
<BOS> Sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .    37.0147
<BOS> Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .    18.5354
<BOS> Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced .    34.6863
<BOS> I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . " In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet .    23.4983
<BOS> I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .    39.3617
<BOS> Jenkinson to make up her party .    44.2189
<BOS> But however he did not .    20.4034
<BOS> Bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh ! that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .    35.0907
<BOS> The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin .    44.0152
<BOS> No principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with Mr . Darcy .    19.4408
<BOS> And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty - - which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless .    41.7207
<BOS> He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father .    28.0110
<BOS> At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr . Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .    31.9739
<BOS> He still loves me , and we are engaged . " Jane looked at her doubtingly .    14.8198
<BOS> He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .    22.9898
<BOS> My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says .    25.5012
<BOS> This cannot be ! - - engaged to Mr . Darcy ! No , no , you shall not deceive me .    16.6163
<BOS> " You have insulted me , in every possible method .    22.4555
<BOS> But you know married women have never much time for writing .    74.6114
<BOS> I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .    42.9613
<BOS> He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .    47.6904
<BOS> But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .    24.9431
<BOS> Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . " " Take care , Lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . " Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .    38.1211
<BOS> To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go .    15.4032
<BOS> Her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .    30.4012
<BOS> " But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ?    8.7154
<BOS> Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .    27.8062
<BOS> Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .    34.2230
<BOS> It mortifies me .    18.2233
<BOS> But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride . " " Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " " Yes .    27.3309
<BOS> Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing - room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself .    30.9670
<BOS> Bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .    18.2322
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs .    18.9904
<BOS> But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done .    15.6430
<BOS> Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .    24.6228
<BOS> Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home .    18.7713
<BOS> I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr . Darcy . " " He likes to have his own way very well , " replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .    20.3418
<BOS> " I cannot see why Mrs .    19.7824
<BOS> I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .    24.8900
<BOS> Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .    33.7882
<BOS> She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .    19.2071
<BOS> They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .    25.2454
<BOS> Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .    50.8384
<BOS> It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .    27.6504
<BOS> " But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs .    15.1308
<BOS> She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .    26.4744
<BOS> " I am , dear Sir , & c .    9.7489
<BOS> Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .    37.1944
<BOS> I came to try you .    28.8451
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> They have at least that advantage . " " The country , " said Darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .    33.4202
<BOS> You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham .    37.3268
<BOS> His doing so drew her notice .    56.3697
<BOS> Bennet .    14.5780
<BOS> The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . " Mr . Darcy , who was leaning against the mantle - piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .    32.0478
<BOS> Do not let us quarrel about the past .    19.3240
<BOS> He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .    21.0165
<BOS> Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .    31.2749
<BOS> But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .    19.9687
<BOS> No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .    43.3009
<BOS> His temptation is not adequate to the risk . " " Do you really think so ? " cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment .    18.3864
<BOS> Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ' s character .    28.4646
<BOS> But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs .    25.9140
<BOS> It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Mr . Bingley her sister ' s being in town .    30.4740
<BOS> A clear ten thousand per annum .    48.1178
<BOS> She could not think of Darcy ' s leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .    23.0928
<BOS> As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship ! - - How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! - - How much of good or evil must be done by him ! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .    36.8352
<BOS> What could be the meaning of it ? - - It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know .    22.9244
<BOS> He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .    34.7721
<BOS> Miss Bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .    24.5405
<BOS> But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia ' s marriage .    42.4328
<BOS> But , really , I know not what to say .    30.4831
<BOS> When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .    35.4620
<BOS> to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing .    48.9698
<BOS> The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia .    18.7311
<BOS> Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life .    33.7881
<BOS> Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .    50.2820
<BOS> Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .    49.2556
<BOS> I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone . " " My uncle is to send a servant for us . " " Oh ! - - Your uncle ! - - He keeps a man - servant , does he ? - - I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .    21.7894
<BOS> " I began to be afraid you would never come back again .    18.6164
<BOS> Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield .    37.6765
<BOS> My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . " The discussion of Mr . Collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .    37.1252
<BOS> How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too ! But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly .    71.3887
<BOS> Each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr . Bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them .    20.1379
<BOS> Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . " And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .    38.1619
<BOS> She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .    48.5412
<BOS> I shall like it of all things .    23.0023
<BOS> Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .    43.8104
<BOS> " But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well . " " Is my father in town ? " " Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word . " " And have you heard from him often ? " " We have heard only once .    23.0745
<BOS> Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends .    37.2046
<BOS> Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .    76.6061
<BOS> " I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .    21.9921
<BOS> The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .    15.4504
<BOS> Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country .    15.2178
<BOS> I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son - in - law . " The loss of her daughter made Mrs .    26.4497
<BOS> " I wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . " " I do not at all know ; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield .    16.4568
<BOS> On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .    28.8127
<BOS> The particulars , I reserve till we meet .    42.6299
<BOS> " In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . " While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .    45.4054
<BOS> I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . " " Ten thousand pounds ! Heaven forbid ! How is half such a sum to be repaid ? " Mr . Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .    22.0969
<BOS> How are you all ? " " My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken .    26.5493
<BOS> The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited .    15.4752
<BOS> That he has neither integrity nor honour .    28.2902
<BOS> F .    12.7179
<BOS> But there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .    38.3092
<BOS> The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs .    41.3259
<BOS> A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .    44.1664
<BOS> If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him .    28.0685
<BOS> " You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . - - Are you much acquainted with Mr . Darcy ? " " As much as I ever wish to be , " cried Elizabeth warmly , - - " I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . " " I have no right to give my opinion , " said Wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise .    21.5791
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Mr . Wickham ' s chief object was unquestionably my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .    23.5738
<BOS> He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay .    28.5007
<BOS> " DEAR SIR , " I must trouble you once more for congratulations .    32.7835
<BOS> Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him .    18.0075
<BOS> If he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go .    39.8658
<BOS> " You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .    27.5503
<BOS> Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . " " It is from Miss Bingley , " said Jane , and then read it aloud .    18.0303
<BOS> She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .    22.4336
<BOS> Mr . Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god - son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .    29.9006
<BOS> " You may well warn me against such an evil .    18.9053
<BOS> But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede .    32.4875
<BOS> We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . " " Mr . Darcy , you see , is the man ! Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you .    30.7446
<BOS> He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions - - about her pleasure in being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . and Mrs .    39.1398
<BOS> It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . " " Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " " Both , " replied Elizabeth archly ; " for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . - - We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all    30.5228
the eclat of a proverb . " " This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , " said he .    11.5760
<BOS> Your sister I also watched . - - Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening ' s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment . - - If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error .    39.8642
<BOS> But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .    42.4395
<BOS> Of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough .    48.2966
<BOS> I was never more annoyed ! The insipidity and yet the noise ; the nothingness and yet the self - importance of all these people ! - - What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! " " Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you .    34.6267
<BOS> She felt anew the justice of Mr . Darcy ' s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .    25.3722
<BOS> Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well - bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs .    51.2757
<BOS> forgive the question - - are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " There can be no doubt of that .    21.4745
<BOS> Bennet ' s ill humour or ill health .    37.4628
<BOS> It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .    55.2948
<BOS> But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation .    34.4932
<BOS> He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings .    33.1914
<BOS> His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .    44.8410
<BOS> My affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . " Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .    48.3066
<BOS> He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .    32.4800
<BOS> Her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .    37.5970
<BOS> I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh .    69.6507
<BOS> In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said , " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . - - I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . " Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .    29.8081
<BOS> Compliments always take you by surprise , and me never .    97.3464
<BOS> Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming .    37.9759
<BOS> That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .    25.5020
<BOS> The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you .    33.3882
<BOS> The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .    45.0632
<BOS> When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane .    32.7020
<BOS> " This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said Mrs .    19.3242
<BOS> " Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .    28.1508
<BOS> Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .    33.5847
<BOS> If he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till Sir William was out of sight .    25.8155
<BOS> Mr . Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr . Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .    38.3678
<BOS> He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill - consequences of Lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone .    31.5714
<BOS> How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .    45.3274
<BOS> are sufficiently known .    148.4796
<BOS> When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr . Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , Mrs .    37.1283
<BOS> " But what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? - - what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " " A thorough , determined dislike of me - - a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .    32.9907
<BOS> In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .    79.3860
<BOS> " I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself - - for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . " He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , " My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? - - Mr . Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . - - You cannot refuse to    32.3142
dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . " And taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , " Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . - - I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . " Mr . Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain .    28.2563
<BOS> All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .    21.9086
<BOS> Mr . Bennet could not have chosen better .    15.5580
<BOS> By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , - - but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .    38.1972
<BOS> I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from you .    35.8139
<BOS> Charles , when you build your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . " " I wish it may . " " But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model .    35.5648
<BOS> She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .    23.7362
<BOS> You take delight in vexing me .    60.4832
<BOS> After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr . Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr . and Mrs .    25.0390
<BOS> I am going away myself . " " No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . - - I desire you will stay where you are . " - - And upon Elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr . Collins . " Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction - - and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion .    37.1434
<BOS> As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .    33.6926
<BOS> But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .    54.4632
<BOS> Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .    53.3278
<BOS> She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs .    27.2361
<BOS> " She is a great deal too ill to be moved .    17.7035
<BOS> As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?    57.4507
<BOS> He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us .    45.0506
<BOS> The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense .    53.3674
<BOS> Jane was distressed .    20.8029
<BOS> Mr . Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs .    28.0674
<BOS> Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness .    30.1919
<BOS> She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .    20.4478
<BOS> I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . " Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .    43.9726
<BOS> She is quite a little creature .    21.2350
<BOS> Miss Bingley I am sure cannot .    66.7550
<BOS> Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you . " Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .    26.4461
<BOS> His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .    25.6170
<BOS> " The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . " " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .    32.9367
<BOS> She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it .    42.6192
<BOS> My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . " " You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short silence .    34.9483
<BOS> They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread - bare morality to listen to .    43.4268
<BOS> His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! Oh ! it must be my uncle ' s doings ! Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself .    26.0786
<BOS> But what does he say of the living ? " " He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only . " " I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley ' s sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .    25.8410
<BOS> He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .    43.8433
<BOS> Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .    33.6318
<BOS> In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her - - a present from my master ; she comes here to - morrow with him . " Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; Mrs .    42.4030
<BOS> Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .    35.3895
<BOS> You supposed more than really existed .    47.5994
<BOS> Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .    37.6745
<BOS> It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .    38.5843
<BOS> I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford .    28.4370
<BOS> As for Jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ' s ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .    25.2388
<BOS> " You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .    28.8296
<BOS> Collins .    39.1775
<BOS> And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs .    29.6236
<BOS> You need not .    29.8449
<BOS> Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great .    16.8651
<BOS> He comes down on Thursday at the latest , very likely on Wednesday .    48.5099
<BOS> Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .    52.7651
<BOS> Long is as good a creature as ever lived - - and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . " Mrs .    36.8647
<BOS> Philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason .    26.4828
<BOS> A fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little .    36.0815
<BOS> And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment .    29.9159
<BOS> Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .    34.7014
<BOS> Hill , in great astonishment , " don ' t you know there is an express come for master from Mr . Gardiner ?    48.3913
<BOS> " I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news .    26.8974
<BOS> Without a governess you must have been neglected . " " Compared with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .    43.5698
<BOS> Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .    50.0936
<BOS> She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .    27.4930
<BOS> " You quite mistook Mr . Darcy .    14.7221
<BOS> I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . " " Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . " " And do you like her ? " " Very much . " " I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .    25.5812
<BOS> This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .    60.3622
<BOS> Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject .    25.9629
<BOS> " Do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .    24.6022
<BOS> Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .    30.9375
<BOS> But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit .    22.0204
<BOS> But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place - - which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years .    43.4460
<BOS> But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman - like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way .    36.7979
<BOS> Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . " " I believe she did - - and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . " " Mr . Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . " " Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .    32.2993
<BOS> The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune .    47.8177
<BOS> You must and shall be married by a special licence .    38.9113
<BOS> It is highly improper .    14.4643
<BOS> He was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' She a beauty ! - - I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . " " Yes , " replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but that was only when I first knew her ,    54.4328
for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . " He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .    28.1214
<BOS> I know no harm of her . " " But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather ' s death made her mistress of this fortune . " " No - - why should he ?    31.5883
<BOS> Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .    69.4815
<BOS> I dearly love a laugh . " " Miss Bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be .    21.2948
<BOS> " I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , - - a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . " Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .    29.6745
<BOS> With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .    26.5692
<BOS> Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .    24.3951
<BOS> This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . " Miss Bennet still looked all amazement .    33.6670
<BOS> And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " You may depend on it , " replied the other , " for Mrs .    20.2053
<BOS> " Not yet , " replied Jane .    14.0102
<BOS> " Oh ! my dear Lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? " " Oh , lord ! I don ' t know .    12.9486
<BOS> To be sure that did seem as if he admired her - - indeed I rather believe he did - - I heard something about it - - but I hardly know what - - something about Mr . Robinson . " " Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr . Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ?    35.4366
<BOS> He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .    45.9637
<BOS> Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world .    50.8481
<BOS> She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .    35.1934
<BOS> His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .    36.9054
<BOS> When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr . Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .    24.4480
<BOS> I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them .    34.7277
<BOS> In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam .    41.1638
<BOS> Bennet with civil self - command to Miss Lucas .    25.8610
<BOS> As long as she stays there , it is all very well .    18.1274
<BOS> Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .    38.7402
<BOS> Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival .    16.0798
<BOS> I know your disposition , Lizzy .    21.2557
<BOS> I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you ! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect .    30.5853
<BOS> " Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . " Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .    39.7085
<BOS> You will be a very happy woman . " Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .    20.2222
<BOS> Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .    19.7356
<BOS> I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .    21.2439
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .    9.4110
<BOS> I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses .    27.0756
<BOS> Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant admission to the house .    30.8563
<BOS> " It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she .    15.8787
<BOS> But it is all , all too late now . " " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved - - shocked .    19.4321
<BOS> All loveliness and goodness as she is ! Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .    44.5031
<BOS> They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too .    25.2566
<BOS> " Do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently .    23.5365
<BOS> If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents .    40.7466
<BOS> There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . " " No , nothing at all . " " A great deal of good management , depend upon it .    12.4246
<BOS> is she handsome ? " " She is a most charming young lady indeed .    23.9713
<BOS> Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " - - And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .    22.6329
<BOS> " I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? " " I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .    31.5621
<BOS> " It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . " " Undoubtedly .    22.7689
<BOS> Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing - room , that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house .    23.5043
<BOS> You tear them to pieces . " " Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully .    18.5378
<BOS> To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .    40.0339
<BOS> " Lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ?    11.8517
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . " " You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr . Darcy ? " " Indeed I am .    17.5340
<BOS> In that case he would return no more .    42.2222
<BOS> She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .    32.8259
<BOS> Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .    24.8461
<BOS> But Mr . Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .    44.4377
<BOS> When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .    16.8347
<BOS> He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .    25.9859
<BOS> Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself .    49.4999
<BOS> How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves .    55.5346
<BOS> His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence .    35.8568
<BOS> Mr . Bennet treated the matter differently .    28.8997
<BOS> " And this is always the way with him , " she added . - - " Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .    25.9029
<BOS> Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before .    21.4382
<BOS> It was lady Catherine de Bourgh .    17.5478
<BOS> It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .    35.4174
<BOS> You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane .    21.9937
<BOS> " By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent .    34.8589
<BOS> And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . " She replied in the affirmative .    18.8914
<BOS> Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs .    21.8554
<BOS> At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .    26.6620
<BOS> Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me .    22.0375
<BOS> Mr . Wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Mr . Collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .    21.1310
<BOS> On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of Jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .    43.1038
<BOS> Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but Mr . Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr . Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .    37.7231
<BOS> It was agreed to .    29.3132
<BOS> I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . " She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh ! Mr . Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar .    20.1301
<BOS> I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .    63.7247
<BOS> Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .    37.7253
<BOS> The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .    25.0864
<BOS> Oh ! that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . " " Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them .    26.7612
<BOS> And she was only sixteen last June .    31.2608
<BOS> Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .    30.7747
<BOS> Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? - - Impossible .    38.0924
<BOS> But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . " This was a sad omen of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for .    28.4733
<BOS> How could I be so silly as to wish it ! Your idea of the ponies is delightful .    33.0411
<BOS> Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard - heartedness in any of the family .    46.3556
<BOS> Her fellow - travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .    35.9065
<BOS> The second began .    53.0654
<BOS> I do not trust my own partiality .    19.1231
<BOS> I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .    23.7155
<BOS> They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .    32.7961
<BOS> Are you going much farther ? " " No , I should have turned in a moment . " And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together .    38.2043
<BOS> The garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving .    27.1286
<BOS> In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ?    45.2514
<BOS> He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .    31.5610
<BOS> When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing - room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .    30.0072
<BOS> I have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims .    15.9833
<BOS> From what can it proceed ?    42.3283
<BOS> Her reflections were in general satisfactory .    33.7264
<BOS> My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .    37.6273
<BOS> You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . " " Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? " " Indeed I had .    43.8120
<BOS> What did Colonel Forster say ?    45.2022
<BOS> Philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .    25.8073
<BOS> Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . - - " As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say - - she could not positively answer - - but she did not know of any prepossession ; - - her eldest daughter , she must just mention - - she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . " Mr . Collins had only to    41.7906
change from Jane to Elizabeth - - and it was soon done - - done while Mrs .    30.8260
<BOS> Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? " " In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . " " Oh ! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road . " " Well , then - - supposing them to be in London .    26.6409
<BOS> Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .    32.6005
<BOS> Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs .    32.5116
<BOS> " Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . " She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .    28.5540
<BOS> Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .    38.8064
<BOS> Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . " Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .    33.9820
<BOS> But it was her business to be satisfied - - and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .    33.0572
<BOS> After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .    64.5977
<BOS> Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?    78.7050
<BOS> " It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , " said Mr . Bennet , " and nothing can clear Mr . Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn .    18.2421
<BOS> She dared not even mention that gentleman .    35.0628
<BOS> Bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .    21.4776
<BOS> Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy ' s looks and behaviour .    20.4355
<BOS> Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .    37.5644
<BOS> There is nothing else to be done .    9.4165
<BOS> But Elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .    28.5107
<BOS> After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .    67.8829
<BOS> Oh ! what hours of transport we shall spend ! And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing .    39.5693
<BOS> " Good gracious ! " cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! - - and yet how many things have happened ! " " A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh .    21.5131
<BOS> Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .    41.3820
<BOS> " What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! " she cried .    34.7091
<BOS> From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .    26.2523
<BOS> I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes .    26.7695
<BOS> I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . " " Nor I , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley .    18.0797
<BOS> Bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " Well , Jane , who is it from ?    22.7313
<BOS> This information , however , startled Mrs .    25.7762
<BOS> It is nearly fifty miles . " " And what is fifty miles of good road ?    28.3159
<BOS> Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .    63.6598
<BOS> You do not look well .    15.8641
<BOS> She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .    28.8479
<BOS> From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . - - Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr . Collins , and I will never see you again if you do . " Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs .    18.2562
<BOS> She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .    38.1340
<BOS> I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . " " Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .    28.7745
<BOS> Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr . Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .    34.5089
<BOS> " Oh ! my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .    15.8240
<BOS> " No ; but it must be done soon . " Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .    29.5012
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .    28.0590
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once .    48.8148
<BOS> I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .    34.5991
<BOS> It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .    40.1709
<BOS> Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way .    22.1713
<BOS> The day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .    23.9880
<BOS> Their sister ' s wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .    23.9611
<BOS> She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .    26.9045
<BOS> Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .    28.7790
<BOS> I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine .    39.1167
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> I am very , very sorry .    29.2596
<BOS> The officers will find women better worth their notice .    72.6212
<BOS> I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .    47.9069
<BOS> She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .    29.4588
<BOS> Bennet ' s eyes sparkled . - - " A gentleman and a stranger ! It is Mr . Bingley I am sure .    12.6089
<BOS> She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s maiden name ? - - Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . - - Lady Catherine then observed , " Your father ' s estate is entailed on Mr . Collins , I think .    27.9734
<BOS> She did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .    32.1143
<BOS> " Implacable resentment is a shade in a character .    35.7694
<BOS> From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink .    23.1328
<BOS> Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ?    43.7756
<BOS> It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . " " Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . " Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .    23.9789
<BOS> My friend has an excellent understanding - - though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr . Collins as the wisest thing she ever did .    27.4917
<BOS> You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .    43.5322
<BOS> The day passed much as the day before had done .    28.6077
<BOS> I do not deserve it .    10.2330
<BOS> Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it .    16.2601
<BOS> While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr . Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .    33.1359
<BOS> The carriage was sent to meet them at - - - - , and they were to return in it , by dinner - time .    27.6144
<BOS> Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .    37.0111
<BOS> and his answering immediately to the last question - - Oh ! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . " " Upon my word ! - - Well , that was very decided indeed - - that does seem as if - - - - but however , it may all come to nothing you know . " " My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , " said Charlotte .    30.6742
<BOS> I did not think Mrs .    9.5165
<BOS> So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . " During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening .    24.9509
<BOS> Why , he has four or five thousand a - year , and very likely more . " Then addressing her daughter , " Oh ! my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! I am sure I sha ' nt get a wink of sleep all night .    23.7512
<BOS> She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .    54.3726
<BOS> Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . " Every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight .    34.0280
<BOS> Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs .    33.1066
<BOS> " Excuse my interference . - - It was kindly meant . " " Insolent girl ! " said Elizabeth to herself . - - " You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .    22.6369
<BOS> The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .    38.0307
<BOS> " His father was an excellent man , " said Mrs .    9.3566
<BOS> She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ! " A man who has once been refused ! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?    42.0468
<BOS> Lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard , and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him .    44.6003
<BOS> " Could I expect it to be otherwise ! " said she .    14.4691
<BOS> Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs .    40.2118
<BOS> Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .    55.2179
<BOS> " Oh ! " said she , " I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply .    21.5148
<BOS> When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , " This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .    44.2828
<BOS> " Oh ! my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately .    12.1096
<BOS> The party did not supply much conversation .    33.8651
<BOS> Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .    74.2288
<BOS> Yes , there was something in that ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . " " I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . " " You did ! and it was not wholly without foundation .    40.8565
<BOS> We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .    58.9772
<BOS> We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way .    35.8395
<BOS> But I have other provocations .    21.2751
<BOS> They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . " Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .    41.9540
<BOS> They will have nothing else to do . " Mr . Wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s .    14.2927
<BOS> My dear Jane , Mr . Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking .    26.9787
<BOS> Charlotte the wife of Mr . Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! - - And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .    38.0506
<BOS> Oh ! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him .    55.6774
<BOS> Rendered spiritless by the ill - success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother - in - law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .    41.1965
<BOS> Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .    21.2290
<BOS> " It may perhaps be pleasant , " replied Charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .    20.0585
<BOS> Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley ' s visit in Gracechurch - street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .    41.5501
<BOS> Kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .    73.6658
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman - like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .    29.7118
<BOS> Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report .    46.8781
<BOS> With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs .    111.6994
<BOS> I must find Mr . Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . " " Good God ! what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr . and Mrs .    31.3887
<BOS> I know it to be impossible . " " This is a wretched beginning indeed ! My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .    20.2321
<BOS> But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .    73.2578
<BOS> It was dated from Rosings , at eight o ' clock in the morning , and was as follows : - - " Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .    28.2897
<BOS> It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .    43.4122
<BOS> That is the place to get husbands .    36.8640
<BOS> Have all her friends left her ? " " Mrs .    33.7223
<BOS> But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .    38.2291
<BOS> If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . " " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ' s disposition as you do . " " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . " " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .    22.3511
<BOS> You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . " She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .    48.2115
<BOS> Never mind Miss Lizzy ' s hair . " " We will be down as soon as we can , " said Jane ; " but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . " " Oh ! hang Kitty ! what has she to do with it ?    27.1777
<BOS> I always said it must be so , at last .    35.8632
<BOS> He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs .    24.5946
<BOS> All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .    34.0319
<BOS> Brother - in - law of Wickham ! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .    45.2358
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .    30.0072
<BOS> My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .    19.8198
<BOS> Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .    29.2673
<BOS> One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .    32.6398
<BOS> In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief .    31.6653
<BOS> She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr . Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows . " Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr . Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening .    37.0122
<BOS> A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it - - or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .    42.2518
<BOS> The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have prompted .    29.0506
<BOS> The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .    29.8468
<BOS> In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over .    35.0684
<BOS> Our poor mother is sadly grieved .    50.5144
<BOS> Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs .    95.1076
<BOS> " What can be the meaning of this ! " said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone .    12.1250
<BOS> Bennet instantly answered , " Oh dear ! - - Yes - - certainly . - - I am sure Lizzy will be very happy - - I am sure she can have no objection . - - Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs . " And gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , " Dear Ma ' am , do not go . - - I beg you will not go . - - Mr . Collins must excuse me . - - He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .    19.7004
<BOS> Though her manner varied however , her determination never did .    56.8406
<BOS> Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .    40.6117
<BOS> Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age .    25.9919
<BOS> Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , Papa , what news ?    37.2392
<BOS> " If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , " said Mrs .    18.1963
<BOS> I hope she will turn out well . " " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . " " Did you go by the village of Kympton ? " " I do not recollect that we did . " " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had .    23.1441
<BOS> He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .    51.5267
<BOS> " While Mary is adjusting her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to Mr . Bingley . " " I am sick of Mr . Bingley , " cried his wife .    14.4833
<BOS> Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together - - and four evenings may do a great deal . " " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . " " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if    34.2850
she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .    34.2400
<BOS> " Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?    30.1091
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .    24.7556
<BOS> On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all .    48.3720
<BOS> Mr . Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .    23.6085
<BOS> It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .    30.8130
<BOS> " I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places .    56.1175
<BOS> And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern - - and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . " " And this is your real opinion ! This is your final resolve ! Very well .    30.1820
<BOS> The loo table , however , did not appear .    15.8512
<BOS> Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .    69.2807
<BOS> Into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance .    32.4413
<BOS> He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere .    49.4863
<BOS> " I did not know that you intended to walk , " said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .    17.2330
<BOS> Every thing being settled between them , Mr . Darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch - street the evening before I came home .    30.3630
<BOS> He could not speak a word for full ten minutes .    26.1139
<BOS> Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs .    39.3417
<BOS> I am the happiest creature in the world .    8.9926
<BOS> Long .    23.4770
<BOS> Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his mayoralty .    26.6822
<BOS> She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . " Jane shook her head .    22.7671
<BOS> If it was not allowable for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . " " A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .    48.5744
<BOS> " I am afraid , Mr . Darcy , " observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . " " Not at all , " he replied ; " they were brightened by the exercise . " - - A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs .    22.3826
<BOS> It was as follows : " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire .    33.1356
<BOS> At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance .    23.4287
<BOS> " You doubt me , " cried Jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason .    22.3266
<BOS> Philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .    21.4793
<BOS> They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry .    80.2087
<BOS> Mr . Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them .    21.8147
<BOS> Did you see him while you were at Lambton ?    23.1621
<BOS> The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .    18.9543
<BOS> No one but Mrs .    30.3658
<BOS> At any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . " With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .    28.5181
<BOS> She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .    40.2498
<BOS> When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .    20.3333
<BOS> " I have sent for you on an affair of importance .    39.6820
<BOS> But on returning to the drawing - room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .    22.8112
<BOS> This son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .    47.1293
<BOS> I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . " " Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs .    16.7394
<BOS> No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; - - the very shoe - roses for Netherfield were got by proxy .    48.1838
<BOS> They will never be distressed for money .    25.6536
<BOS> Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . " How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! Her aunt now called her to look at a picture .    49.3658
<BOS> She declared her resolution .    31.3183
<BOS> And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . " " But you see that Jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . " " Of whom does Jane ever think ill ?    26.6842
<BOS> I cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . " And with a bow to Mr . Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . - - Many stared . - - Many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr . Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr . Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half - whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .    30.4862
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .    27.8602
<BOS> She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected - - " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . " He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .    28.9047
<BOS> He placed himself by her .    34.8549
<BOS> She will not be able to help calling . " " She will drop the acquaintance entirely . " But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ' s being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .    33.5045
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .    34.4728
<BOS> Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .    21.5207
<BOS> They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .    27.0159
<BOS> I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! " " I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love , " said Darcy .    27.4758
<BOS> After walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .    24.6457
<BOS> Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her .    27.3454
<BOS> I am not equal to it .    13.0729
<BOS> " My dear , dear aunt , " she rapturously cried , " what delight ! what felicity ! You give me fresh life and vigour .    41.1217
<BOS> Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .    33.2095
<BOS> The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .    29.7310
<BOS> Mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . - - Elizabeth was in agonies .    28.3621
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away .    37.4008
<BOS> Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr . Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .    36.3750
<BOS> Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .    30.5708
<BOS> My feelings will not be repressed .    13.3564
<BOS> Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " " It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began .    25.0929
<BOS> Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy .    22.3784
<BOS> Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . - - I know it cannot be long . " He readily assured her of his secrecy - - again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away .    41.9702
<BOS> That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr . Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .    25.8556
<BOS> Collins well . " " Yes , very well .    21.5214
<BOS> I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .    59.6485
<BOS> She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . " The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .    41.6085
<BOS> Had Lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned .    32.2860
<BOS> Those who do not complain are never pitied . " Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .    68.4723
<BOS> But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .    54.5249
<BOS> There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . " Mr . Wickham ' s attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh .    33.7803
<BOS> Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .    60.3957
<BOS> I thought him very sly ; - - he hardly ever mentioned your name .    31.5735
<BOS> You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone .    60.4699
<BOS> What could your ladyship propose by it ? " " At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . " " Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , " said Elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . " " If ! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?    27.5649
<BOS> To Mr . Darcy it was welcome intelligence - - Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough .    28.4082
<BOS> To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .    52.4112
<BOS> You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .    33.2077
<BOS> They walked on , without knowing in what direction .    21.1097
<BOS> Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . " Their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs .    54.0072
<BOS> She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all .    34.4152
<BOS> Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria .    20.7370
<BOS> He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .    46.2013
<BOS> He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire .    26.0314
<BOS> When they repaired to the dining - room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .    20.8842
<BOS> Lord ! how I laughed ! and so did Mrs .    44.0241
<BOS> Their powers of conversation were considerable .    32.3363
<BOS> From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr . Collins ' s side , and as many bows on Sir William ' s , they departed .    20.0541
<BOS> Unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only child ) I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .    59.8537
<BOS> My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . " " You may depend upon it , Madam , " said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , " that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . " Mrs .    17.9604
<BOS> Bennet ' s schemes for this day were ineffectual .    24.5443
<BOS> Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .    20.1422
<BOS> " I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . " " You are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! - - always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! - - If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . " On Miss Lucas ' s persevering , however , she added , " Very well ; if it must be so , it must . " And gravely glancing at Mr . Darcy , "    25.1227
There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with - - ' Keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' - - and I shall keep mine to swell my song . " Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .    38.4366
<BOS> The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour ' s tête - à - tête with Mrs .    16.4679
<BOS> I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it .    36.7893
<BOS> It was to be such a secret ! " " If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the subject .    15.5260
<BOS> She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .    27.0645
<BOS> Indeed , Mr . Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire - - and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too - - for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . " " I am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly .    24.0895
<BOS> Gardiner could not but be deeply affected .    35.4135
<BOS> But she would not be secure .    18.4764
<BOS> The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr . Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings .    52.8163
<BOS> It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .    25.7863
<BOS> " And that I suppose is one of your sisters . " " Yes , madam , " said Mrs .    8.9138
<BOS> How much you must have gone through ! " Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr . and Mrs .    24.2929
<BOS> You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself - - for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . " Elizabeth could not but look surprised .    33.2709
<BOS> The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .    31.1611
<BOS> " Well , Lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ?    29.9311
<BOS> It is such a spur to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .    36.4124
<BOS> While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise - - all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible .    44.7874
<BOS> I want to talk very seriously .    23.0340
<BOS> On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . " It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .    35.0020
<BOS> " The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .    30.8726
<BOS> If she does not object to it , why should we ? " " Her not objecting , does not justify him .    44.2321
<BOS> Bingley is most unaffectedly modest .    35.1575
<BOS> Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . - - But their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle .    37.9944
<BOS> On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?    27.4415
<BOS> But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .    53.0451
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .    33.4223
<BOS> I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr . Bingley .    21.2285
<BOS> Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough .    31.1696
<BOS> I am sick of them all .    11.7786
<BOS> How shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth .    21.6257
<BOS> But his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr . Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .    29.5825
<BOS> Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . " " I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .    30.2457
<BOS> She answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .    28.6490
<BOS> At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . " " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth .    13.7562
<BOS> " Oh , Lizzy ! it cannot be .    11.1233
<BOS> I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr . Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .    23.7844
<BOS> I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject . " " Not so hasty , if you please .    17.5793
<BOS> But I know the foundation is unjust .    31.2444
<BOS> Mr . Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia .    32.2423
<BOS> She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . " " No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . " Mrs .    13.0629
<BOS> Bennet .    14.5780
<BOS> With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! Affectation of candour is common enough ; - - one meets it every where .    46.4066
<BOS> Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked .    19.5798
<BOS> On entering the drawing - room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book .    29.9986
<BOS> In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .    32.5809
<BOS> He is gone to my father already .    29.3417
<BOS> But here he was set right by Mrs .    60.7396
<BOS> Family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .    34.6614
<BOS> Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . " The girls stared at their father .    32.1951
<BOS> I was uncomfortable enough .    18.0464
<BOS> Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat - - a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return .    18.6821
<BOS> He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good - natured , gossiping Lucases .    34.6166
<BOS> I have by no means done .    16.6193
<BOS> And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?    80.2376
<BOS> Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it .    34.8747
<BOS> " You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . " " Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling .    20.0947
<BOS> Is it true ? " Elizabeth replied that it was .    25.5533
<BOS> He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .    27.7403
<BOS> Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .    29.1040
<BOS> Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented .    36.2246
<BOS> The officer was the very Mr . Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .    53.6271
<BOS> That lady I suppose is your mother . " Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .    43.2268
<BOS> It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining .    23.1704
<BOS> They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .    26.0225
<BOS> The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr . Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .    56.6408
<BOS> She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation .    37.4784
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> You deserve no such attention .    32.3558
<BOS> The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .    32.7157
<BOS> Mamma would like to go too of all things ! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " " Yes , " thought Elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .    44.8145
<BOS> The old lady is Mrs .    17.6442
<BOS> When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .    44.3476
<BOS> In Lydia ' s imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .    36.9776
<BOS> As no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all Mr . Collins ' s scruples of leaving Mr . and Mrs .    22.6218
<BOS> Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .    52.3382
<BOS> He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .    23.0931
<BOS> Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .    43.9456
<BOS> " Good Heaven ! can it be really so ! Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane .    19.1212
<BOS> But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . " " No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .    19.4919
<BOS> Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .    18.9095
<BOS> Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever .    27.5270
<BOS> And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .    23.3112
<BOS> We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , - - only think what fun ! Not a soul knew of it , but Col .    60.8259
<BOS> " My aunt , " she continued , " is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor - street . " She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley .    19.5414
<BOS> So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart .    66.2533
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects .    49.3092
<BOS> The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia ' s infamy somewhat better .    38.1271
<BOS> It was unpardonable .    12.1696
<BOS> He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company .    33.7550
<BOS> Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .    37.1415
<BOS> In revolving lady Catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .    32.7519
<BOS> But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .    51.3073
<BOS> A most welcome negative followed the last question - - and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .    36.6706
<BOS> Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding . " Mrs .    29.6491
<BOS> A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self - denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .    50.5935
<BOS> After a short silence , the lady first spoke .    45.3597
<BOS> Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her .    41.1555
<BOS> I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr . Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself .    34.5784
<BOS> But now it comes out . " " My motive for cautioning you , is as follows .    29.8475
<BOS> The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . - - He carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear .    38.0162
<BOS> He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . " On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? " " With great energy ; - - but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . " "    35.0016
You are severe on us . " " It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas .    19.7347
<BOS> He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " It is above eight months .    34.4476
<BOS> Good gracious ! when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . " Her father lifted up his eyes .    25.1220
<BOS> She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged .    49.7386
<BOS> Does she live near you , sir ? " " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship ' s residence . " " I think you said she was a widow , sir ?    49.4601
<BOS> Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . " " Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .    42.8148
<BOS> " On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago .    27.2979
<BOS> With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? " " Nearly three weeks . " " And you saw him frequently ? " " Yes , almost every day . " " His manners are very different from his cousin ' s . " " Yes , very different .    21.0619
<BOS> My aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . " " Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .    31.6463
<BOS> But with me , it is not so .    17.5546
<BOS> Risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . " " Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire .    39.8096
<BOS> Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr . Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .    28.0398
<BOS> The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .    31.9750
<BOS> Her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines .    82.0539
<BOS> We seem to have been designed for each other . " Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .    33.0022
<BOS> Elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .    38.4830
<BOS> " Your ' s , & c . " This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .    24.8058
<BOS> But of course she did not mention my name to you . " " Yes , she did . " " And what did she say ? " " That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had - - not turned out well .    25.5732
<BOS> Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time .    74.6940
<BOS> The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .    25.3226
<BOS> " And pray may I ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " Is it in address that he improves ?    37.0657
<BOS> The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .    26.3736
<BOS> You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .    18.9413
<BOS> Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust - - any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .    35.7503
<BOS> With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected .    44.2837
<BOS> Philips . - - The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .    42.5068
<BOS> But who was your mother ?    35.6870
<BOS> But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .    22.1517
<BOS> You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short lease . " " Whatever I do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes .    26.4736
<BOS> Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .    23.0019
<BOS> At first there seemed danger of Lydia ' s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular .    48.3571
<BOS> We will know where we have gone - - we will recollect what we have seen .    39.5527
<BOS> But Mr . Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr . Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .    23.7065
<BOS> She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good - naturedly engaged Mr . Collins ' s conversation to herself .    25.3169
<BOS> " I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter .    33.6223
<BOS> " When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? " " To - morrow fortnight . " " Aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and Mrs .    14.1094
<BOS> She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas .    23.8373
<BOS> " I am all astonishment .    19.2296
<BOS> Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .    31.5875
<BOS> To Mrs .    9.9573
<BOS> I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .    30.6029
<BOS> Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .    42.3959
<BOS> " Oh ! Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! If I could but see you as happy ! If there were but such another man for you ! " " If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you .    34.4694
<BOS> Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ?    51.1237
<BOS> Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .    45.0469
<BOS> It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .    22.0926
<BOS> But , however , that shan ' t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined .    18.6068
<BOS> " You forget that I have made no answer .    13.0051
<BOS> It must be an amusing study . " " Yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing .    20.0939
<BOS> He seldom appeared really animated .    43.5420
<BOS> With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .    44.1631
<BOS> Bennet , " that is exactly what I could most wish for .    24.3103
<BOS> In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .    33.3431
<BOS> Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .    35.6903
<BOS> I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .    23.9811
<BOS> Put them next to your great uncle the judge .    127.5017
<BOS> I will have no reserves from you . " " Mr . Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .    19.3025
<BOS> He has children of his own , and may have more .    39.9084
<BOS> Miss Bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by Caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him .    29.1132
<BOS> But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could . " " Would Mr . Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? " " Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself . " " You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged .    34.1657
<BOS> After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to Elizabeth , " I hope you are well , Miss Bennet .    19.2424
<BOS> Bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .    40.5874
<BOS> He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . " " Perfectly so - - I thank you . " She found that she was to receive no other answer - - and , after a short pause , added , " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? " " I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .    20.2945
<BOS> He replied , and was again silent .    33.0989
<BOS> When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her . - - Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr . Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . - - I am excessively attentive to all those things .    36.0944
<BOS> " If I had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her .    22.8865
<BOS> I am impatient to see him . " " In point of composition , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem defective .    14.0322
<BOS> Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .    78.3680
<BOS> Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .    23.3442
<BOS> What relates to yourself , is as follows .    31.0350
<BOS> " You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .    18.5773
<BOS> From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .    39.4403
<BOS> She liked him too little to care for his approbation .    22.2629
<BOS> He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein .    27.7098
<BOS> Have you seen any pleasant men ?    107.0428
<BOS> It seemed like wilful ill - nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .    50.0488
<BOS> When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous .    36.3008
<BOS> He bore it however with admirable calmness .    52.7297
<BOS> You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .    36.7964
<BOS> Steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her .    29.9303
<BOS> Poor Jane ! I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .    31.8406
<BOS> Bennet give up the point .    64.9794
<BOS> Its completion depended on others .    36.4956
<BOS> It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the - - - - shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .    19.5257
<BOS> Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .    38.0903
<BOS> It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration .    24.8821
<BOS> There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter , which promises well .    17.9555
<BOS> Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , " Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .    26.5881
<BOS> They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ! - - Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr . Darcy ' s steward .    29.6238
<BOS> It was all pride and insolence .    12.8814
<BOS> But of every other neglect I can believe him capable .    39.4428
<BOS> She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances : - - and to have Mr . Collins instead ! her liveliness had been never worse timed .    63.5777
<BOS> She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .    35.6684
<BOS> It was very little less .    16.7460
<BOS> As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . " With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .    44.9840
<BOS> She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .    29.5766
<BOS> She had never heard of him before his entrance into the - - - - shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .    22.1141
<BOS> or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?    92.2122
<BOS> But that is one great difference between us .    38.8571
<BOS> There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again .    42.4424
<BOS> Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield .    31.6413
<BOS> " Where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door .    13.3414
<BOS> As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . " " That you certainly shall . " " And I have another favour to ask .    27.6407
<BOS> Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .    18.0977
<BOS> Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical .    26.4056
<BOS> Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .    33.3264
<BOS> I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . " Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection .    42.0557
<BOS> She shared in their attendance on Mrs .    23.5721
<BOS> I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her .    55.1525
<BOS> Mr . Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active superintendance , and when immediately before my father ' s death , Mr . Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself . " " How strange ! " cried Elizabeth .    20.3941
<BOS> Oh ! my sweetest Lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! What pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! Jane ' s is nothing to it - - nothing at all .    40.5011
<BOS> Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .    30.9983
<BOS> Reynolds could interest her on no other point .    61.1820
<BOS> They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .    29.6343
<BOS> Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece .    43.8072
<BOS> She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley .    30.6546
<BOS> I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely .    40.7138
<BOS> Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party .    22.2904
<BOS> Hurst and Elizabeth herself .    22.3278
<BOS> She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself .    46.2892
<BOS> He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .    33.0737
<BOS> She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening .    33.1527
<BOS> Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James ' s .    39.1472
<BOS> As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " This is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of .    40.6155
<BOS> Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room .    23.5512
<BOS> Mr . Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .    48.5527
<BOS> I rather wonder now at your knowing any . " " Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? " " I never saw such a woman .    25.9183
<BOS> His character is thereby complete . " " I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .    22.2064
<BOS> His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .    48.3936
<BOS> Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr . Darcy by character perfectly well .    45.8792
<BOS> I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage . " Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse - woman , walking was her only alternative .    34.3087
<BOS> She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin .    31.5332
<BOS> Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . " " Which do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men .    30.1556
<BOS> " I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , " said he .    27.7351
<BOS> But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . " Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .    30.9095
<BOS> I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . " Mrs .    24.7639
<BOS> " I do not know when I have been more shocked , " said she .    10.1930
<BOS> Bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . " In a few days Mr . Bingley returned Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .    21.2851
<BOS> Mr . Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding .    24.7593
<BOS> I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . " Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .    24.1400
<BOS> But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is .    32.9360
<BOS> Once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear .    39.6727
<BOS> Such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! It is really too distressing .    50.6490
<BOS> Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . " " These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth .    25.3304
<BOS> Why any fear of detection ?    73.6558
<BOS> Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr . Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . " " What is his name ? " " Bingley . " " Is he married or single ? " " Oh ! single , my dear , to be sure ! A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year .    33.3416
<BOS> I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park .    22.7945
<BOS> I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? " Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .    34.2186
<BOS> Through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .    47.5870
<BOS> Bennet could hardly comprehend it .    17.0473
<BOS> Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .    26.1585
<BOS> Wickham ! How well it sounds .    50.6258
<BOS> She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .    28.6894
<BOS> He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .    36.8053
<BOS> Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , " said she , " though I am not her particular friend .    24.7531
<BOS> His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by .    38.3496
<BOS> Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " Yes , and I had heard it before .    26.6454
<BOS> Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .    17.6069
<BOS> This will never do . " " You need not distress yourself .    27.4522
<BOS> Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . " Elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit .    21.7156
<BOS> " Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room . " Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing - room .    24.6753
<BOS> " I hope , " added Mrs .    7.6632
<BOS> But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation . " Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable - - that one false step involves her in endless ruin - - that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , - - and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . " Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed    34.1072
to make any reply .    18.5529
<BOS> Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased .    41.4454
<BOS> My aunt told me so herself on Saturday .    48.0118
<BOS> But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .    56.7715
<BOS> When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing .    17.5055
<BOS> Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above - mentioned ; and while Mr . Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress .    48.4262
<BOS> There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . " Wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , " You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must    38.1284
rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .    19.8767
<BOS> I was ready to die of laughter .    25.2693
<BOS> But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ?    30.8565
<BOS> They have some of the finest woods in the country . " Elizabeth said no more - - but her mind could not acquiesce .    18.7495
<BOS> The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .    46.2328
<BOS> You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .    65.8827
<BOS> " E .    13.2107
<BOS> " What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr . Darcy ! - - There is nothing like dancing after all . - - I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . " " Certainly , Sir ; - - and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world . - - Every savage can dance . " Sir William only smiled .    25.8588
<BOS> The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs .    31.4972
<BOS> Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .    72.2445
<BOS> We acted with the best intentions . " " Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia ' s note to his wife ? " " He brought it with him for us to see . " Jane then took it from her pocket - book , and gave it to Elizabeth .    30.6202
<BOS> The coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn .    35.0572
<BOS> Mr . Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . - - Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase .    32.1704
<BOS> She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .    28.2644
<BOS> My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .    21.7598
<BOS> Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .    44.2893
<BOS> If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen .    20.3455
<BOS> After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .    57.5901
<BOS> But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill - success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .    54.4897
<BOS> It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .    28.7347
<BOS> Collins was settled near her family . " " It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire .    24.3595
<BOS> When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs .    38.7844
<BOS> Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .    25.1076
<BOS> And in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia ' s relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount .    30.6066
<BOS> Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not . " " You are over scrupulous surely .    21.2264
<BOS> It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr . Collins joining in , observed , " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her .    25.4449
<BOS> Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .    25.4593
<BOS> But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .    33.0440
<BOS> I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .    38.5582
<BOS> At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable .    22.9791
<BOS> Bennet said only , " Nonsense , nonsense ! " " What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? " cried he .    18.9627
<BOS> I cannot quite agree with you there .    27.8651
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .    16.2369
<BOS> Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr . Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr . Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .    40.9115
<BOS> Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . " " But I was embarrassed . " " And so was I . " " You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . " " A man who had felt less , might . " " How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .    29.5589
<BOS> Such a charming man ! - - so handsome ! so tall ! - - Oh , my dear Lizzy ! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .    16.3610
<BOS> She could think of nothing but of Mr . Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr . Collins were once silent .    29.0509
<BOS> Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge .    43.2313
<BOS> But are you pleased , Jane ?    35.2028
<BOS> Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .    36.1922
<BOS> With assumed tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success .    21.6234
<BOS> She related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .    12.7767
<BOS> Nobody can tell what I suffer ! - - But it is always so .    30.3956
<BOS> He added , that Mr . Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon .    25.6774
<BOS> With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .    32.4762
<BOS> As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . - - Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr . Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh .    28.4564
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> In the dining - room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before .    22.6497
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; Oxford , Blenheim , Warwick , Kenelworth , Birmingham , & c .    25.0624
<BOS> At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion .    58.1124
<BOS> Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast .    39.0760
<BOS> They had frequently been staying with her in town .    22.3698
<BOS> His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . " Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry .    37.2019
<BOS> It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour .    28.1229
<BOS> who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B .    60.2201
<BOS> " I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled .    33.8643
<BOS> In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?    68.4717
<BOS> In talking over their route the evening before , Mrs .    23.5076
<BOS> That he was not a good - tempered man , had been her firmest opinion .    21.0462
<BOS> He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire .    22.6610
<BOS> On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .    23.9708
<BOS> What a stroke was this for poor Jane ! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .    58.1804
<BOS> He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .    23.9460
<BOS> Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . " Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .    21.3057
<BOS> She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid .    32.3018
<BOS> It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best .    25.3779
<BOS> " My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? " Mr . Bennet replied that he had not .    23.0230
<BOS> I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good .    39.1014
<BOS> But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .    20.4299
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> " There is nothing the matter with me .    13.9332
<BOS> That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued - - that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .    37.1709
<BOS> The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .    27.0231
<BOS> Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss ! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted .    35.4076
<BOS> " And may I ask ? " said Elizabeth , " but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . " " Complied with ! I am only ashamed of his asking so little . " " And they must marry ! Yet he is such a man ! " " Yes , yes , they must marry .    18.4118
<BOS> Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ' s folly . " " Indeed you are mistaken .    21.3164
<BOS> I cannot think so very ill of Wickham .    13.5010
<BOS> Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs .    28.8594
<BOS> They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .    42.5717
<BOS> When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .    21.3313
<BOS> He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done .    36.4646
<BOS> Regard for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but I wrote to Mr . Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs .    20.9343
<BOS> I am afraid you will be angry . " " My dearest sister , now be be serious .    18.6598
<BOS> My father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .    23.3141
<BOS> Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! are quite well . " " But you - - How are you ? " cried Elizabeth .    15.6085
<BOS> They all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses .    15.8784
<BOS> When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were .    27.4691
<BOS> Pray do not talk of that odious man .    19.3949
<BOS> She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him .    22.1965
<BOS> We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr . Wickham with money . " " Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ?    17.7309
<BOS> Darcy said nothing at all .    25.1011
<BOS> What could be more natural than his asking you again ?    33.5335
<BOS> What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .    23.4257
<BOS> They solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .    43.1372
<BOS> She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .    21.9558
<BOS> But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good .    25.8110
<BOS> They must all go to Brighton .    21.5980
<BOS> The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .    28.2573
<BOS> This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day . " " Oh , yes .    24.4012
<BOS> Her mother ' s ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth ' s mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family .    28.2985
<BOS> Jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected .    22.0302
<BOS> When the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .    17.0663
<BOS> But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . - - That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , - - but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears . - - I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; - - I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . - - My objections to the marriage were    36.8372
not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . - - But there were other causes of repugnance ; - - causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . - - These causes must be stated , though briefly . - - The situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost    49.7946
uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father . - - Pardon me . - - It pains me to offend you .    24.1505
<BOS> She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy .    34.6750
<BOS> How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .    19.4827
<BOS> It amazes me , I confess ; - - for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction .    27.4162
<BOS> While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .    36.8974
<BOS> You may depend upon my seeking no further . " " Oh ! certainly , " said Elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . " " Thank you , " said Lydia , " for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . " On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .    25.0014
<BOS> To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs .    45.7775
<BOS> Mr . Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .    46.2779
<BOS> Their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses ' reach .    49.9469
<BOS> From Elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent .    30.9228
<BOS> This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .    34.3744
<BOS> He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . " " If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .    52.2043
<BOS> I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .    23.1226
<BOS> I quite detest the man . " When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr . Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .    31.4891
<BOS> " Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance .    13.2239
<BOS> He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood - - the sort of preference which was often given me . " " I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this - - though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him - - I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! " After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his    28.7958
having an unforgiving temper .    22.5605
<BOS> A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .    58.1493
<BOS> She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .    22.0893
<BOS> Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .    40.2037
<BOS> This room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .    44.6163
<BOS> His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ?    54.4785
<BOS> I am so grieved for him .    16.5570
<BOS> what does he say ?    54.6613
<BOS> Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .    61.7235
<BOS> She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour .    19.3784
<BOS> The latter was thinking only of his breakfast .    35.9639
<BOS> In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . " She was gone directly .    23.0684
<BOS> Good bye . " She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .    34.5631
<BOS> Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ?    54.7442
<BOS> Only look at her .    19.6788
<BOS> " You used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs .    35.4709
<BOS> Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh ' s foot - stool , that she said , ' Mr . Collins , you must marry .    20.9757
<BOS> " You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; - - if the first , I should be completely in your way ; - - and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . " " Oh ! shocking ! " cried Miss Bingley .    31.4516
<BOS> Kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy .    47.4834
<BOS> I cannot do justice to his kindness .    36.4433
<BOS> " I often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends .    21.2188
<BOS> He had to be sure done much .    51.0853
<BOS> I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . " A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and Mrs .    28.5185
<BOS> Their reception at home was most kind .    30.2304
<BOS> You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? " " Blame you ! Oh , no . " " But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham . " " No - - I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . " " But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . " She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham .    19.3347
<BOS> Other schemes too came into her head .    77.7857
<BOS> You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .    36.6390
<BOS> Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .    42.0807
<BOS> I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . - - Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life .    34.7818
<BOS> It was only said , ' Lately , George Wickham , Esq .    27.4167
<BOS> It only shews her being deficient in something herself - - sense or feeling . " " Well , " cried Elizabeth , " have it as you choose .    34.5662
<BOS> I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .    29.0166
<BOS> It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr . Darcy ! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before .    32.9259
<BOS> Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . ' She did indeed .    48.6579
<BOS> My temper I dare not vouch for . - - It is I believe too little yielding - - certainly too little for the convenience of the world .    22.1243
<BOS> Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .    25.6020
<BOS> Oh , Lizzy ! do any thing rather than marry without affection .    49.1215
<BOS> They agreed that Mrs .    22.1719
<BOS> Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .    42.5694
<BOS> How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .    33.2113
<BOS> Mr . Bennet ' s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .    29.3892
<BOS> I shall go distracted . " This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .    32.2037
<BOS> Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .    31.1493
<BOS> I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies .    46.9460
<BOS> " A gamester ! " she cried .    11.0000
<BOS> Well , well , I only hope it will last .    32.7529
<BOS> That he should even speak to her was amazing ! - - but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .    41.6860
<BOS> I shall never forget her appearance this morning .    32.7223
<BOS> I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not .    19.4407
<BOS> I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , frankly and openly . " Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .    32.0273
<BOS> You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . " " I hope not so .    33.4273
<BOS> " My dearest child , " she cried , " I can think of nothing else ! Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! ' Tis as good as a Lord ! And a special licence .    20.9322
<BOS> It was a fortnight since Mrs .    11.3497
<BOS> His surprise was great .    37.8778
<BOS> There - - I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable .    33.7576
<BOS> Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully .    69.2079
<BOS> But does not Jane correspond with the sister ?    42.4063
<BOS> She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable .    23.0298
<BOS> His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .    30.3613
<BOS> Mr . Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .    23.4162
<BOS> But think no more of the letter .    25.5189
<BOS> My reasons for believing it are briefly these : - - It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .    56.9228
<BOS> At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .    38.0961
<BOS> " I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr . Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .    29.1616
<BOS> Such very superior dancing is not often seen .    80.2676
<BOS> The letter was to this effect : " MY DEAR LIZZY , " I wish you joy .    14.1076
<BOS> Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford - - between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs .    59.3113
<BOS> My father bears it better .    26.7876
<BOS> Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .    23.9162
<BOS> One seems so forlorn without them . " " This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said Elizabeth .    25.2702
<BOS> for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . " " Oh , no ! " said Elizabeth .    22.9387
<BOS> But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you .    25.4866
<BOS> Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Mr . Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . " " Oh ! " said Lydia stoutly , " I am not afraid ; for though I am the youngest , I ' m the tallest . " The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr . Bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .    18.9228
<BOS> They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .    25.0603
<BOS> She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " Oh , my dear Eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! I will not tell you what it is .    24.5415
<BOS> Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out .    49.9389
<BOS> I was afraid they might not ; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . " Elizabeth could bear it no longer .    63.0339
<BOS> Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .    42.0271
<BOS> Elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .    37.6946
<BOS> I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .    33.2488
<BOS> You have delighted us long enough .    23.8944
<BOS> Gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .    38.0154
<BOS> At night she opened her heart to Jane .    48.0365
<BOS> Bingley urged Mr . Jones ' s being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians .    58.6167
<BOS> Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage .    40.0173
<BOS> But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character .    41.8255
<BOS> " But how did he account for it ? " " It must have been his sister ' s doing .    17.5696
<BOS> From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help .    44.5814
<BOS> A small sum could not do all this . " " No , " said her father , " Wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .    19.0435
<BOS> You see how continually we are engaged there .    60.6452
<BOS> Women fancy admiration means more than it does . " " And men take care that they should . " " If it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . " " I am far from attributing any part of Mr . Bingley ' s conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .    37.9435
<BOS> But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs .    40.0542
<BOS> It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution . " Darcy smiled and said , " You are perfectly right .    27.0261
<BOS> When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn .    21.1429
<BOS> When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " " These are home questions - - and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature .    50.7739
<BOS> When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so .    63.0627
<BOS> Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off .    40.0594
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .    52.7378
<BOS> My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can ' t write ; so I will dictate , and you write for me .    22.3896
<BOS> My fingers wait your orders . " " Perhaps , " said Darcy , " I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . " " Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam .    30.2010
<BOS> That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . " Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before they did .    38.2753
<BOS> It must be his own doing . - - He is his own master .    17.3414
<BOS> I pity , though I cannot help blaming her .    25.7706
<BOS> Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected .    35.1583
<BOS> If I wished to think slightingly of any body ' s children , it should not be of my own however . " " If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it . " " Yes - - but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . " " This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree .    23.0110
<BOS> Bennet and Mrs .    6.5873
<BOS> " She is so fond of Mrs .    12.2411
<BOS> They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . " " You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound .    30.8795
<BOS> They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs .    29.1807
<BOS> Mr . Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .    22.9701
<BOS> Mr . Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .    29.8043
<BOS> Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs .    45.5569
<BOS> And do you really love him quite well enough ?    42.8115
<BOS> Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .    33.0343
<BOS> Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related .    50.9265
<BOS> After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F .    64.5789
<BOS> Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . " " You are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . " To such perseverance in wilful self - deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive ,    38.6104
and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female .    36.6152
<BOS> Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur .    37.7854
<BOS> Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .    34.7044
<BOS> However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves . " Mrs .    26.4060
<BOS> It is impossible for me to be impartial .    11.2044
<BOS> About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .    39.9472
<BOS> We were married , you know , at St . Clement ' s , because Wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish .    25.4765
<BOS> I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . " " I am not now to learn , " replied Mr . Collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .    32.2582
<BOS> Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine .    32.3643
<BOS> Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth .    38.5967
<BOS> Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .    28.6516
<BOS> The venison was roasted to a turn - - and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .    27.8393
<BOS> Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .    35.2768
<BOS> Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . " A few days after this visit , Mr . Bingley called again , and alone .    20.8070
<BOS> Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object .    21.9143
<BOS> It is every way horrible ! " Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence .    30.7535
<BOS> But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? - - Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by them . " " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter .    54.1127
<BOS> By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .    34.8535
<BOS> Oh ! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! " " Oh ! my dear , " continued Mrs .    13.9705
<BOS> She could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on .    35.9184
<BOS> With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .    44.0849
<BOS> They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . " " Aye - - that is because you have the right disposition .    32.7206
<BOS> What a fine thing for our girls ! " " How so ?    57.1588
<BOS> Consider Mr . Collins ' s respectability , and Charlotte ' s prudent , steady character .    16.7896
<BOS> It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . " " Very true , indeed ; - - and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? - - Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . " " Laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .    29.9801
<BOS> An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure .    15.9180
<BOS> In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .    30.5846
<BOS> Well , how pleased I am ! and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . " " Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said Mr . Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .    19.1458
<BOS> Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .    25.8217
<BOS> Pray read on . " " After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .    40.5552
<BOS> Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority .    42.3174
<BOS> " And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into . " Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .    39.2453
<BOS> I can recal nothing worse .    33.9022
<BOS> But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs .    13.1878
<BOS> But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most .    59.0636
<BOS> Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr . Collins , in describing the civility of Mr . and Mrs .    23.8637
<BOS> You may imagine what I felt and how I acted .    35.4673
<BOS> She will be down in a moment I dare say . " He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .    30.0555
<BOS> She really looked almost wild . " " She did indeed , Louisa .    58.7488
<BOS> Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Mr . Collins began .    17.1632
<BOS> Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .    47.1281
<BOS> Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .    40.1657
<BOS> I depend on you for that . " To these high flown expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr . Bingley ' s being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .    37.1116
<BOS> Bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way . - - But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all - - and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead . - - I shall not be able to keep you - - and so I warn you . - - I have done with you from this very day . - - I told you in the    28.3565
library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .    16.5163
<BOS> It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy ' s proposals .    29.3588
<BOS> This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . " " Not as you represent it .    21.7711
<BOS> Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .    36.7129
<BOS> " Your ' s sincerely , & c . " Miss Bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .    20.9822
<BOS> I should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several . " " Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added Charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . " " Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say .    19.2930
<BOS> I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .    49.7796
<BOS> Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .    48.4681
<BOS> She read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again .    22.6560
<BOS> But , alas ! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself - - from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .    32.6753
<BOS> Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . " And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr . Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .    40.8644
<BOS> Shall you like to have such a brother ? " " Very , very much .    23.6443
<BOS> Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man .    34.0190
<BOS> Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say .    13.5112
<BOS> " He is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived .    18.4259
<BOS> I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .    31.8599
<BOS> Bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls .    29.3624
<BOS> I must speak to Hill , this moment . " " It is not Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . " This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .    17.5673
<BOS> Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .    21.6565
<BOS> I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . " " My dear Mr . Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . - - When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .    32.4970
<BOS> Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .    55.1357
<BOS> came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through .    30.2888
<BOS> For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter .    31.4297
<BOS> It adds even another motive .    65.5409
<BOS> " Oh ! yes - - the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! - - She plays and sings all day long .    28.6849
<BOS> Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said , " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month .    23.6358
<BOS> Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .    21.7242
<BOS> Miss Lucas is married and settled .    61.0337
<BOS> Mr . Darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me .    19.4305
<BOS> After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re - appear at Longbourn .    34.7347
<BOS> I am confident that she would have performed delightfully .    20.0971
<BOS> I am not qualified to form one .    18.2600
<BOS> Had Elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .    26.0927
<BOS> A great deal more passed at the other table .    19.6744
<BOS> Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight .    145.2749
<BOS> I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .    34.1000
<BOS> Secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly - - which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness .    27.5739
<BOS> He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .    24.4018
<BOS> Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time .    24.8704
<BOS> Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged .    35.7130
<BOS> And is such a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ?    22.2924
<BOS> These recollections will not do at all .    18.6470
<BOS> Miss Bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs .    30.8710
<BOS> I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ?    44.6016
<BOS> They will ruin your happiness .    31.2587
<BOS> Society , I own , is necessary to me .    35.8648
<BOS> Bennet thus began the projected conversation . - - " Oh ! Mr . Collins ! " - - " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point .    14.2199
<BOS> " Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them .    32.1181
<BOS> Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .    46.5281
<BOS> This was his plan of amends - - of atonement - - for inheriting their father ' s estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .    28.6914
<BOS> Calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly .    48.2982
<BOS> But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room .    23.8386
<BOS> The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .    49.7921
<BOS> From the drawing - room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .    38.6507
<BOS> She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost .    25.1851
<BOS> An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs .    22.3393
<BOS> " I have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech .    14.1361
<BOS> His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , - - allowing something for fortune and figure . " The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr . Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs .    35.6639
<BOS> Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it .    38.2936
<BOS> He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " Just as you please . " " May we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " Take whatever you like , and get away . " Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .    24.5691
<BOS> " But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . " Elizabeth made no objection ; - - the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .    23.5228
<BOS> Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .    25.1004
<BOS> Even Elizabeth began to fear - - not that Bingley was indifferent - - but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .    30.4111
<BOS> They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . " " It was a subject which they could not mention before me . " " No . It would have been strange if they had .    33.3116
<BOS> After a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .    24.6810
<BOS> If he no longer cares for me , why silent ?    56.6285
<BOS> And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ?    41.5557
<BOS> " His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . " " Indeed , " replied Elizabeth , " I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .    27.3559
<BOS> Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .    30.3266
<BOS> I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .    48.1658
<BOS> With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr . Darcy afterwards discharged .    41.7960
<BOS> She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .    24.9185
<BOS> In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs .    18.2777
<BOS> The dejection was almost universal .    30.4505
<BOS> Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return .    48.1832
<BOS> That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .    44.2943
<BOS> It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . " " Lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . " " I did not know before , " continued Bingley immediately , " that you were a studier of character .    29.7961
<BOS> You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; - - though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . " " I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .    29.7209
<BOS> It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . " The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs .    35.0170
<BOS> intending to trace their route .    47.4663
<BOS> Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .    38.3065
<BOS> Mr . Darcy is engaged to my daughter .    14.7078
<BOS> She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .    28.8650
<BOS> Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield .    40.6099
<BOS> Your ' s , very sincerely , " M .    22.7266
<BOS> When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door .    45.3309
<BOS> The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation - - a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street .    45.1404
<BOS> When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . - - Elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her .    25.8377
<BOS> They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . " " Beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , " replied Jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .    42.0813
<BOS> Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " As Mrs .    29.2417
<BOS> He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty .    26.5593
<BOS> His sense of her inferiority - - of its being a degradation - - of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .    43.3123
<BOS> On the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .    42.0830
<BOS> The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .    38.1406
<BOS> And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs .    27.5009
<BOS> But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .    25.9713
<BOS> You mentioned two instances .    84.8128
<BOS> It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . " " It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said Bingley .    45.9936
<BOS> Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart - felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .    39.4345
<BOS> If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .    21.0087
<BOS> Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton .    30.0897
<BOS> He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .    47.0204
<BOS> But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .    77.3846
<BOS> At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters .    47.5701
<BOS> Mr . Darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding .    8.3746
<BOS> You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . " Mr . Bingley arrived .    25.8678
<BOS> He begged pardon for having displeased her .    23.5437
<BOS> There was no help for it however .    23.1191
<BOS> I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .    18.9809
<BOS> Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor . " This was not very consoling to Mrs .    16.9795
<BOS> The hall , the dining - room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs .    20.6081
<BOS> Four nieces of Mrs .    22.9177
<BOS> It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half - hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .    45.0212
<BOS> These are conditions , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you .    26.6312
<BOS> When the ladies returned to the drawing - room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .    32.7575
<BOS> But , Lizzy ! Oh , sister ! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr . Collins ' s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .    22.9723
<BOS> Lydia ' s being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites .    29.6572
<BOS> This , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal ; and it was settled that Mr . Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better .    23.2528
<BOS> Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?    36.9729
<BOS> Wholly inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .    36.2430
<BOS> When you told Mrs .    21.5548
<BOS> If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .    51.7279
<BOS> The general prejudice against Mr . Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .    29.4954
<BOS> You alluded to something else .    55.8183
<BOS> Have not you always hated him ? " How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy .    31.5274
<BOS> Her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to Elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home .    19.3258
<BOS> " Lady Catherine de Bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living .    16.0815
<BOS> To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . " " In what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought Elizabeth .    40.1242
<BOS> Bennet ' s civilities .    9.3916
<BOS> Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .    19.3218
<BOS> Oh ! Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall I bear so much happiness ! " She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty .    30.3439
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley .    27.2820
<BOS> Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .    75.7542
<BOS> Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . " " I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .    23.8377
<BOS> The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .    20.7176
<BOS> They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . Bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .    37.1093
<BOS> Collins so before you came .    53.9200
<BOS> A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . " When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .    48.7371
<BOS> He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .    34.2988
<BOS> I know it all ; that the young man ' s marrying her , was a patched - up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .    29.5712
<BOS> Well , he is a very undeserving young man - - and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .    25.0664
<BOS> The other is Miss De Bourgh .    19.4685
<BOS> His belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .    28.3053
<BOS> That tall , proud man . " " Good gracious ! Mr . Darcy ! - - and so it does I vow .    18.8634
<BOS> " With my mother up stairs .    36.7098
<BOS> " My father and Maria are to come to me in March , " added Charlotte , " and I hope you will consent to be of the party .    18.1870
<BOS> But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . " " Such as vanity and pride . " " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .    27.7081
<BOS> It was gratitude . - - Gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .    34.6594
<BOS> Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him .    24.2050
<BOS> " My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt .    27.0158
<BOS> They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight .    113.9038
<BOS> He is perfectly amiable .    20.1745
<BOS> That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate .    66.6551
<BOS> There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .    27.6580
<BOS> The subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .    40.1754
<BOS> With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .    51.7321
<BOS> It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us .    16.4167
<BOS> But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .    33.4039
<BOS> Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived .    27.6910
<BOS> " It is a long time , Mr . Bingley , since you went away , " said Mrs .    8.4884
<BOS> She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ; - - and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .    51.0781
<BOS> Thank Heaven ! I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .    37.8038
<BOS> His fear of her , has always operated , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . " Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .    24.2575
<BOS> Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .    22.4640
<BOS> Such a countenance , such manners ! and so extremely accomplished for her age ! Her performance on the piano - forte is exquisite . " " It is amazing to me , " said Bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . " " All young ladies accomplished ! My dear Charles , what do you mean ? " " Yes , all of them , I think .    21.4151
<BOS> It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . " " But why all this secrecy ?    39.5520
<BOS> I knew you would be wishing me joy . " " Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .    27.3461
<BOS> He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her .    30.7423
<BOS> I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . " The first week of their return was soon gone .    35.2657
<BOS> But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .    43.0741
<BOS> Till Elizabeth entered the drawing - room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr . Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .    35.4455
<BOS> Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .    37.6651
<BOS> Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .    46.3234
<BOS> Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs .    22.7130
<BOS> Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .    34.9940
<BOS> Its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned .    54.3840
<BOS> Poor Lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .    36.4149
<BOS> Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .    40.0678
<BOS> Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .    24.7655
<BOS> From that moment I observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him .    34.2728
<BOS> His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .    37.8215
<BOS> They insist also on my seeing Mr . Jones - - therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me - - and excepting a sore - throat and head - ache there is not much the matter with me .    35.6645
<BOS> The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr . Wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .    32.0295
<BOS> But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing - room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .    19.9643
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> You blamed me for coming ? " " No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . " " Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you .    37.0458
<BOS> Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed .    40.9314
<BOS> is not this an agreeable surprise ? " " And we mean to treat you all , " added Lydia ; " but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . " Then shewing her purchases : " Look here , I have bought this bonnet .    42.9883
<BOS> Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .    34.1427
<BOS> My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .    45.3088
<BOS> " Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . - - No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .    27.4779
<BOS> There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . " " With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it . " " I am talking of possibilities , Charles . " " Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation . " Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card - table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .    32.0434
<BOS> Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . " " Whatever my connections may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . " " Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " I am not . " Lady Catherine seemed pleased .    29.5927
<BOS> The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood .    26.7155
<BOS> Perhaps there was some truth in this ; though I doubt whether his reserve , or anybody ' s reserve , can be answerable for the event .    48.1196
<BOS> His plan did not vary on seeing them . - - Miss Bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice .    38.4446
<BOS> She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .    41.4266
<BOS> To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs .    37.3091
<BOS> " I dare say you will find him very agreeable . " " Heaven forbid ! - - That would be the greatest misfortune of all ! - - To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! - - Do not wish me such an evil . " When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .    35.2227
<BOS> She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .    25.2243
<BOS> " We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! - - How much I shall have to tell ! " Elizabeth privately added , " And how much I shall have to conceal . " Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Mr . Gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days .    31.5353
<BOS> Had I but explained some part of it only - - some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! Had his character been known , this could not have happened .    44.1670
<BOS> His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .    16.5713
<BOS> Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .    89.3281
<BOS> " It keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . " Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .    25.6569
<BOS> I am not romantic you know .    10.5631
<BOS> This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty - seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .    30.2266
<BOS> " That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs .    13.3525
<BOS> And so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ?    53.2499
<BOS> I have not a doubt of your doing very well together .    21.1125
<BOS> Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " Oh , yes ! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . " " What do you mean ? " " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley .    16.7750
<BOS> I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .    32.6246
<BOS> How he lived I know not .    57.1310
<BOS> It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . " " I like her appearance , " said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas .    26.9446
<BOS> The officers may not be so pleasant in General - - - - ' s regiment . " His daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .    31.2328
<BOS> " Yes , Ma ' am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him - - just as affable to the poor . " Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .    31.9868
<BOS> " This fine account of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . " " Perhaps we might be deceived . " " That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . " On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting - room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley .    32.3951
<BOS> He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying - - and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . " " And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? " " How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ! I felt a little uneasy - - a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .    35.2715
<BOS> " Only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .    34.7111
<BOS> If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . " " Sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs .    44.5421
<BOS> They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .    28.2817
<BOS> He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .    22.5559
<BOS> On both sides it was only assertion .    53.6592
<BOS> F .    12.7179
<BOS> Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .    30.0169
<BOS> But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia ' s leaving home .    28.3411
<BOS> But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .    24.9857
<BOS> For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ' s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .    34.6091
<BOS> I shall now know how to act .    33.5618
<BOS> Could she have seen half as much love in Mr . Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .    45.1722
<BOS> You have done all this ! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . " " And this , " cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! This is the estimation in which you hold me ! I thank you for explaining it so fully .    31.5618
<BOS> Pray , how violent was Mr . Bingley ' s love ? " " I never saw a more promising inclination .    21.5196
<BOS> " Sure he will not leave London before he has found them .    35.1743
<BOS> He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .    32.4395
<BOS> He has heartily forgiven me now . " Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .    29.6945
<BOS> I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte ' s marriage .    44.5105
<BOS> No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .    106.0426
<BOS> Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham ' s extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .    40.8615
<BOS> Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; - - but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .    24.7522
<BOS> Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .    27.7910
<BOS> Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .    28.7798
<BOS> It will not do .    16.3255
<BOS> Her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .    47.2068
<BOS> Elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .    42.3756
<BOS> You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .    30.6819
<BOS> At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .    20.3274
<BOS> She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .    29.6076
<BOS> Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .    38.7108
<BOS> Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been .    32.4758
<BOS> She was overpowered by shame and vexation .    13.8088
<BOS> Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .    34.9874
<BOS> If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . " But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .    34.2453
<BOS> Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .    24.1982
<BOS> She was teazed by Mr . Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .    16.5839
<BOS> In understanding Darcy was the superior .    67.1852
<BOS> Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were .    38.4863
<BOS> But you are always giving her the preference . " " They have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . " " Mr . Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?    23.7325
<BOS> About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs .    45.6688
<BOS> Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .    37.0625
<BOS> Their brother is a pleasant gentleman - like man - - he is a great friend of Darcy ' s . " " Oh ! yes , " said Elizabeth drily - - " Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr . Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . " " Care of him ! - - Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .    20.5167
<BOS> She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation .    29.5438
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> " Let us sit down .    17.1949
<BOS> Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill - judged thing in the world ! How strange must it appear to him ! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! Oh ! why did she come ?    58.8587
<BOS> " You began the evening well , Charlotte , " said Mrs .    24.0970
<BOS> His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .    37.3204
<BOS> Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .    28.9888
<BOS> In spite of having been at St . James ' s , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .    32.6588
<BOS> Mr . Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House .    32.2819
<BOS> He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .    79.4104
<BOS> All was joy and kindness .    91.1457
<BOS> Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?    34.0943
<BOS> " Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley ' s . " " Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? - - At present I have not room to do them justice . " " Oh ! it is of no consequence .    30.2531
<BOS> You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr . Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .    36.8537
<BOS> Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " Sir William ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . " " I do not think we were speaking at all .    19.6239
<BOS> Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him . " Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .    40.1396
<BOS> She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended .    31.4498
<BOS> I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .    23.1815
<BOS> Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him .    17.1264
<BOS> The path just admitted three .    140.6018
<BOS> Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window - - she looked , - - she saw Mr . Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .    24.4941
<BOS> He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney - coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom .    69.0487
<BOS> Let me do it without farther loss of time .    44.6353
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them .    25.8494
<BOS> His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .    50.8213
<BOS> " No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . " " That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . " " Oh ! but the gentlemen will have Mr . Bingley ' s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . " " I had much rather go in the coach . " " But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure .    20.3167
<BOS> Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr . Darcy returned within the stated time .    56.5809
<BOS> " Mr . Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? - - Poor Eliza ! - - to be only just tolerable . " " I beg you would not put it into Lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill - treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .    28.7266
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .    27.7701
<BOS> But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . " " I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton . " " Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . " " That is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .    23.6111
<BOS> My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due . " " My object then , " replied Darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .    29.8826
<BOS> Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .    30.5441
<BOS> She was at least free from the offence of Mr . Darcy ' s farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .    42.5524
<BOS> She has two nieces of her own .    31.6882
<BOS> Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs .    30.4059
<BOS> Can I speak plainer ?    88.1909
<BOS> Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .    28.6280
<BOS> Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?    45.4181
<BOS> Long will do any such thing .    30.6451
<BOS> " It has been a very agreeable day , " said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth .    9.5906
<BOS> Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr . Darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .    24.4612
<BOS> Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .    24.9902
<BOS> Mr . Collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .    13.4279
<BOS> Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .    25.8056
<BOS> She finds Miss Pope a treasure .    25.9171
<BOS> Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton .    32.1174
<BOS> His character was to speak for itself .    32.4784
<BOS> His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .    24.9325
<BOS> The strangeness of Mr . Collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .    22.8029
<BOS> I do think Mrs .    17.6570
<BOS> The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr . Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .    36.1621
<BOS> She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .    36.1839
<BOS> Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to - - - - You shall try it some day . - - Do your sisters play and sing ? " " One of them does . " " Why did not you all learn ? - - You ought all to have learned .    28.9861
<BOS> I know how much you dislike him . " " You know nothing of the matter .    12.3827
<BOS> At length Darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " Mr . Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends - - whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . " " He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied Elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . " Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .    22.1862
<BOS> Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .    52.3260
<BOS> And poor Mr . Darcy ! dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .    25.8819
<BOS> As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .    23.7174
<BOS> The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back .    43.4955
<BOS> Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy ' s meditated elopement .    30.3130
<BOS> " He is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! - - so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! " " He is also handsome , " replied Elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can .    18.9337
<BOS> Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified .    21.8188
<BOS> Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs .    45.1475
<BOS> She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . - - Your ' s , & c .    16.6299
<BOS> Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive .    36.6535
<BOS> " I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her .    13.5762
<BOS> As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out .    38.6729
<BOS> They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it . " " Your first position is false .    24.3372
<BOS> Since the - - - - shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .    29.6199
<BOS> He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .    25.5264
<BOS> Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .    46.7058
<BOS> That is all to be forgot .    16.5704
<BOS> But as it is - - you must not let your fancy run away with you .    31.2011
<BOS> In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .    29.0385
<BOS> And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . " With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn .    43.9325
<BOS> You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people .    20.2963
<BOS> Bennet one day , " what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane ' s ?    41.0084
<BOS> I am so pleased - - so happy .    25.0930
<BOS> Jane was by no means better .    15.0624
<BOS> I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at .    26.1265
<BOS> At five o ' clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner .    32.8535
<BOS> " She looks sickly and cross . - - Yes , she will do for him very well .    21.6957
<BOS> Elizabeth now began to revive .    20.7917
<BOS> How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! - - Why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet .    29.2767
<BOS> The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .    15.3786
<BOS> " But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for .    18.2033
<BOS> The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank - - such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine .    35.9033
<BOS> Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn .    22.9705
<BOS> Teazing , teazing , man ! I will think no more about him . " Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth .    29.6273
<BOS> " Your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings .    19.8546
<BOS> " Oh ! Mary , " said she , " I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .    29.8123
<BOS> It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . " " And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? " " The indirect boast ; - - for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .    41.8955
<BOS> Mr . Collins was also in the same state of angry pride .    18.7991
<BOS> Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt .    31.2426
<BOS> She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .    39.4816
<BOS> By Elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .    38.2156
<BOS> Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable .    40.8931
<BOS> Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .    35.7035
<BOS> It is of all subjects my delight .    38.2066
<BOS> But I am at his disposal .    12.4998
<BOS> I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better .    20.5515
<BOS> I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .    41.6698
<BOS> But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .    41.4429
<BOS> Too much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ?    34.8742
<BOS> You know I have .    22.7756
<BOS> As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .    23.5339
<BOS> You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs .    21.8030
<BOS> " Oh ! dear , yes ; - - but you must own she is very plain .    19.2082
<BOS> It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed .    22.0863
<BOS> He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .    17.5512
<BOS> " Next time you call , " said she , " I hope we shall be more lucky . " He should be particularly happy at any time , & c .    19.5552
<BOS> " About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .    31.1124
<BOS> Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .    35.0135
<BOS> My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance .    24.1129
<BOS> " This will not do , " said Elizabeth .    8.5575
<BOS> But don ' t imagine it was from any silly cause .    50.8046
<BOS> I will take care of myself , and of Mr . Wickham too .    19.3836
<BOS> If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs .    16.3374
<BOS> There was another reason too for her opposition .    44.6764
<BOS> And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .    32.0529
<BOS> Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .    43.9214
<BOS> Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , " You mean to frighten me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?    20.4567
<BOS> Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?    51.8483
<BOS> Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe ' s calling yesterday to thank me ?    41.9504
<BOS> Lydia ' s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr . Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr . Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr . Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Mr . Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford .    26.8750
<BOS> She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .    45.8162
<BOS> To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .    52.9495
<BOS> But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .    28.3507
<BOS> Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .    31.8555
<BOS> Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .    18.8262
<BOS> They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs .    42.2571
<BOS> Mr . and Mrs .    7.9074
<BOS> He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .    26.5051
<BOS> " Let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . " She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door .    30.9627
<BOS> " It must not be thought of .    27.0789
<BOS> In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .    32.8216
<BOS> If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . " * * * * * The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased Mrs .    24.6555
<BOS> They are all for what they can get .    24.7587
<BOS> All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .    49.8606
<BOS> Mr . Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .    27.7768
<BOS> A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two .    48.1577
<BOS> Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough .    44.5644
<BOS> He was well , but so much engaged with Mr . Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him .    15.9272
<BOS> The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .    55.2115
<BOS> Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr . Bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .    26.7793
<BOS> Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .    34.5353
<BOS> If I have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them . - - With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .    38.1214
<BOS> There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him .    27.7772
<BOS> " You begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her .    19.1624
<BOS> Bennet ' s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .    32.8523
<BOS> I told Mrs .    14.7612
<BOS> You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . " " Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent .    21.5075
<BOS> Bennet half opened the door and called out , " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . " Elizabeth was forced to go .    16.8499
<BOS> Poor little Lizzy ! But do not be cast down .    48.6384
<BOS> My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! " " Oh ! Jane , " cried Elizabeth , " was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " " I do not know . - - I hope there was . - - But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult .    20.4101
<BOS> My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .    38.5205
<BOS> Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not .    31.2135
<BOS> I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .    33.1172
<BOS> Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out . - - She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success .    34.7230
<BOS> Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together .    25.6667
<BOS> We will go round the Park every day .    28.0012
<BOS> Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? " " I never heard that it was . " " And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? " " I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .    19.7113
<BOS> We had better go into the avenue . " But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . - - You are charmingly group ' d , and appear to uncommon advantage .    36.8182
<BOS> But is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " Oh yes ! - - They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . " " And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour .    28.9552
<BOS> A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . " " All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . " " I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women .    49.1815
<BOS> " My dear , dear Lizzy , I would - - I do congratulate you - - but are you certain ?    18.4103
<BOS> My feelings in every respect forbid it .    36.0184
<BOS> " She is my youngest girl but one .    44.7626
<BOS> Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .    40.9335
<BOS> He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her .    33.2619
<BOS> " I know not , Miss Elizabeth , " said he , " whether Mrs .    8.9722
<BOS> Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .    44.7166
<BOS> It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . " " It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty .    14.5708
<BOS> There was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .    28.2115
<BOS> She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .    32.7494
<BOS> My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ?    30.8514
<BOS> He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one .    36.9611
<BOS> " My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . " But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .    32.1675
<BOS> No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village .    43.9333
<BOS> By Mrs .    9.5852
<BOS> He does not want abilities .    37.9310
<BOS> He has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . " " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? " He shook his head . - - " I wish I could call her amiable .    27.9650
<BOS> Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .    14.0210
<BOS> I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .    31.1447
<BOS> Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! " " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .    46.8001
<BOS> She had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means .    32.1253
<BOS> Mr . Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ' s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr . Bingley never stirs without him . " " So much the better .    33.9188
<BOS> But your family owe me nothing .    41.5684
<BOS> However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were . " " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently .    21.4285
<BOS> " How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " He made no answer .    21.3813
<BOS> Lydia laughed , and said , " Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .    35.3641
<BOS> Mr . Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .    38.5619
<BOS> I had not an idea of it . " Mr . Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday .    23.1624
<BOS> He immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded .    73.8912
<BOS> Bennet by admiring Mrs .    27.1816
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> They are wanted in the farm , Mr . Bennet , are not they ? " " They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . " " But if you have got them to - day , " said Elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered . " She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .    24.0830
<BOS> My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr . Philips , appears to do so much credit to - - but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr . Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .    31.1912
<BOS> He cannot know what Mr . Darcy is . " " Probably not ; - - but Mr . Darcy can please where he chuses .    18.4998
<BOS> It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .    45.2375
<BOS> Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .    35.0815
<BOS> which will not be yours till after your mother ' s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .    35.5453
<BOS> " You are joking , Lizzy .    11.5116
<BOS> By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .    39.6879
<BOS> She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .    22.9259
<BOS> Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! - - I never heard of such a thing .    20.1872
<BOS> Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr . Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr . Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it .    24.8048
<BOS> I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . " " I can easily believe it .    13.7985
<BOS> Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .    19.4697
<BOS> Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .    36.3543
<BOS> It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .    29.2651
<BOS> As she went up stairs to get ready , Mrs .    26.2935
<BOS> After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " In vain have I struggled .    40.9081
<BOS> Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention .    19.1114
<BOS> But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . " Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved .    46.8628
<BOS> His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret .    30.8573
<BOS> In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .    31.3428
<BOS> I should infinitely prefer a book . " But of this answer Lydia heard not a word .    41.5779
<BOS> It was drawn at the same time as the other - - about eight years ago . " " I have heard much of your master ' s fine person , " said Mrs .    17.5248
<BOS> On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , " Let me call your maid .    22.4948
<BOS> The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .    33.9389
<BOS> Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .    29.2963
<BOS> Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .    52.8231
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .    20.4051
<BOS> If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .    21.4083
<BOS> Their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .    45.5366
<BOS> While she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .    29.4000
<BOS> But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr . Wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .    37.8377
<BOS> You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .    41.2909
<BOS> Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham ' s name .    18.7019
<BOS> Philips ' s vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs .    19.3453
<BOS> This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .    33.9469
<BOS> He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character .    30.2366
<BOS> Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .    68.2343
<BOS> That such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . " " When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other . " " Not the slightest .    29.2405
<BOS> Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .    39.0836
<BOS> How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .    44.0290
<BOS> I only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .    39.6934
<BOS> Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .    25.0021
<BOS> Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .    36.9327
<BOS> The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .    40.2602
<BOS> I will speak to her about it myself directly .    48.1340
<BOS> He was angry .    14.5197
<BOS> She now lost every expectation of pleasure .    48.7235
<BOS> But he is an ugly fellow ! I am glad he is gone .    22.4976
<BOS> What a contrast between him and his friend ! Mr . Darcy danced only once with Mrs .    22.2819
<BOS> I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her .    36.3388
<BOS> Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ?    73.0149
<BOS> You had much better dance . " " I certainly shall not .    24.2101
<BOS> How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? " Mr . Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s proficiency .    37.2306
<BOS> There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! " She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? " " Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . " " And quite alone ?    25.8547
<BOS> His reception however was of the most flattering kind .    36.7768
<BOS> She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .    19.6212
<BOS> There is no danger of Wickham ' s marrying Mary King .    22.6871
<BOS> After lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .    31.9739
<BOS> One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .    36.1423
<BOS> So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! Not handsome enough to dance with ! I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs .    41.7993
<BOS> I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .    50.3335
<BOS> The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each .    29.0051
<BOS> Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " I hope Mr . Bingley will like it Lizzy . " " We are not in a way to know what Mr . Bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . " " But you forget , mama , " said Elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs .    18.2501
<BOS> " MY DEAR NIECE , " I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you .    29.9267
<BOS> They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .    23.6842
<BOS> It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs .    23.8644
<BOS> Your ladyship wants Mr . Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ?    75.6907
<BOS> " I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! " " La ! my dear , " said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not Lady Catherine .    26.8057
<BOS> Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr . Bingley .    22.7500
<BOS> But these are not Jane ' s feelings ; she is not acting by design .    30.8013
<BOS> Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do .    49.9573
<BOS> At that moment , she cared for no other .    28.4689
<BOS> The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen .    39.3658
<BOS> She had obtained private intelligence that Mr . Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr . Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .    36.9991
<BOS> Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .    26.9850
<BOS> I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . " " Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament .    37.7456
<BOS> " Yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " I remember hearing you once say , Mr . Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .    27.9861
<BOS> She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you .    46.8985
<BOS> I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .    37.7096
<BOS> When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when Mrs .    33.1798
<BOS> If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . " " You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .    33.7973
<BOS> For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .    36.6064
<BOS> Lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .    17.0007
<BOS> Seriously , I would have you be on your guard .    28.7436
<BOS> Gardiner abused her stupidity .    38.2506
<BOS> Bennet ' s curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .    21.2426
<BOS> The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , Chatsworth , Dovedale , or the Peak .    26.2757
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .    12.7190
<BOS> " Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs .    9.6078
<BOS> It is what every body says .    23.2768
<BOS> Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . " This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .    42.9377
<BOS> Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? - - A glass of wine ; - - shall I get you one ? - - You are very ill . " " No , I thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to recover herself .    26.3833
<BOS> Her ladyship was highly incensed .    13.7908
<BOS> Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly . " Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .    35.6332
<BOS> She blushed , and Jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .    34.3905
<BOS> Hurst began again .    77.5069
<BOS> Jenkinson ' s room .    17.6851
<BOS> Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .    38.8062
<BOS> All field sports were over .    26.1350
<BOS> You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . " He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long .    27.4389
<BOS> " But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason .    12.2260
<BOS> Bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down .    25.8981
<BOS> After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr . Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday .    43.5774
<BOS> She had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .    29.2495
<BOS> Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs .    27.4304
<BOS> Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .    25.6180
<BOS> Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ?    59.3195
<BOS> The officers of the - - - - shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman - like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr . Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the broad - faced stuffy uncle Philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room .    29.2217
<BOS> The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .    23.7056
<BOS> While in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?    35.4705
<BOS> His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .    28.1469
<BOS> It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .    30.0726
<BOS> " Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane ' s . " Elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .    22.1414
<BOS> People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true .    27.0628
<BOS> The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above .    42.1118
<BOS> His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .    24.1000
<BOS> As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner : - - " You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .    19.0480
<BOS> Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings .    36.5176
<BOS> Teaze him - - laugh at him . - - Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . " " But upon my honour I do not .    18.8890
<BOS> My youngest sister has left all her friends - - has eloped ; - - has thrown herself into the power of - - of Mr . Wickham .    35.7742
<BOS> Miss Bennet ' s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .    51.6829
<BOS> I did not expect such a compliment . " " Did not you ?    17.2070
<BOS> Only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .    29.1547
<BOS> Bennet , alarmed .    21.0812
<BOS> He is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women .    29.1754
<BOS> Her own thoughts were employing her .    22.2608
<BOS> Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth .    44.6551
<BOS> She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . " Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr . Wickham ' s attentions .    35.8959
<BOS> His character was decided .    23.8912
<BOS> Nobody wants him to come .    27.2876
<BOS> I will read it to you - - " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .    36.2882
<BOS> Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .    27.3650
<BOS> Elizabeth could not help saying , " It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . " " I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other .    20.4301
<BOS> If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .    21.9602
<BOS> I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr . Darcy .    42.1569
<BOS> Hear me in silence .    25.2612
<BOS> " Well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ?    14.7741
<BOS> But if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs .    34.2121
<BOS> An union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .    22.9402
<BOS> When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .    36.8755
<BOS> A lively imagination soon settled it all .    50.8358
<BOS> Bennet could hardly contain herself .    17.9312
<BOS> " I am trying to make it out . " " And what is your success ? " She shook her head .    9.5291
<BOS> " Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . " Charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth .    21.9862
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner left them soon after breakfast .    14.9582
<BOS> Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .    43.7320
<BOS> But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .    19.6097
<BOS> Since her father ' s death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . " After many pauses and many trials of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley ! How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?    34.0331
<BOS> You could scarcely escape discredit and misery .    68.1713
<BOS> A lady ' s imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .    43.5837
<BOS> One must speak a little , you know .    27.6627
<BOS> Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way .    49.4766
<BOS> Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys - - and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . " Mr . Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .    36.5644
<BOS> Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .    31.4363
<BOS> Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .    13.9525
<BOS> Catherine , weak - spirited , irritable , and completely under Lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self - willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .    32.5953
<BOS> " You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .    32.3760
<BOS> With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " " What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ? " - - said Jane as she finished it .    39.7926
<BOS> Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair .    32.1103
<BOS> I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham ' s character . " Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , " Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .    31.8613
<BOS> Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .    65.9277
<BOS> If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before - hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .    41.9970
<BOS> The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .    34.8384
<BOS> I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .    20.5058
<BOS> When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs .    21.5300
<BOS> She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .    28.8862
<BOS> Elizabeth silently attended her .    28.7992
<BOS> " Well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy .    10.4326
<BOS> They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .    19.9342
<BOS> " But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .    46.6049
<BOS> Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? " " Oh , yes ! - - that , that is the worst of all .    33.0885
<BOS> Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr . Collins , who was complimenting Mr . Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .    25.0046
<BOS> I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage .    17.0520
<BOS> She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .    19.6214
<BOS> So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .    54.2087
<BOS> And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .    51.9613
<BOS> Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned .    37.1567
<BOS> His revenge would have been complete indeed .    39.9678
<BOS> Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .    41.8894
<BOS> They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .    44.8186
<BOS> I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . " " Upon my word , Sir , " cried Elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .    26.0982
<BOS> I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .    37.6004
<BOS> " You are too hasty , Sir , " she cried .    11.2822
<BOS> Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . - - Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .    37.5350
<BOS> Adieu to disappointment and spleen .    38.4733
<BOS> This was very amiable , but Charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of ; - - its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr . Collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself .    36.7042
<BOS> But there are two things that I want very much to know : - - one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . " " Money ! my uncle ! " cried Jane , " what do you mean , Sir ? " " I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a - year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . " " That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before .    27.4155
<BOS> Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! " " I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power .    24.5052
<BOS> The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .    24.5146
<BOS> Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .    46.6006
<BOS> What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr . Bingley - - is not he ?    36.9604
<BOS> Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . - - Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome .    38.3342
<BOS> We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .    49.2276
<BOS> She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country .    16.8165
<BOS> You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did .    33.0575
<BOS> She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .    24.0923
<BOS> Mr . Bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . " She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .    39.3154
<BOS> His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half - expectation which Mrs .    38.2840
<BOS> He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .    35.9901
<BOS> Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr . Stone .    39.2551
<BOS> My poor father ! how he must have felt it ! " " I never saw any one so shocked .    17.7509
<BOS> Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .    32.2673
<BOS> " Well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " What say you to the day ?    20.2578
<BOS> Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .    34.5341
<BOS> Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth : " My dearest Lizzy , " I FIND myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .    42.1278
<BOS> But they did pass away , and Mr . and Mrs .    16.2145
<BOS> Mr . Bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .    35.4790
<BOS> In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .    40.8601
<BOS> It is a pity they are not handsome ! Not that I think Charlotte so very plain - - but then she is our particular friend . " " She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley .    25.0416
<BOS> I never was .    26.9545
<BOS> Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .    91.3002
<BOS> And you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . " Kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .    34.5599
<BOS> Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .    49.9859
<BOS> You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . " Occupied in observing Mr . Bingley ' s attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .    20.9371
<BOS> But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .    98.3808
<BOS> Why Jane - - you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr . Bingley . - - But - - good lord ! how unlucky ! there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day .    28.2952
<BOS> The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .    54.8012
<BOS> No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; - - a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .    37.5268
<BOS> But slyness seems the fashion .    63.6053
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Bennet .    14.5780
<BOS> There is one point , on which I want your advice .    31.9013
<BOS> I cannot think of it without abhorrence . " " We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said Elizabeth .    21.0122
<BOS> His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .    26.4170
<BOS> But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .    38.7254
<BOS> Why should they try to influence him ?    52.0152
<BOS> The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .    38.9579
<BOS> Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr . Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley ' s witticisms on fine eyes .    26.0156
<BOS> Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .    21.3939
<BOS> Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly .    39.8628
<BOS> Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , - - that I am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day .    49.3351
<BOS> I expected you to stay two months .    40.2627
<BOS> They are my old friends .    43.2708
<BOS> Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately .    33.5449
<BOS> A younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . " " In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either .    29.9025
<BOS> She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .    32.7659
<BOS> We want none of them ; do we ? " Darcy had walked away to another part of the room .    43.0871
<BOS> Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world .    42.5590
<BOS> I thought I should have broke my heart . " " I am sure I shall break mine , " said Lydia .    12.7164
<BOS> On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .    30.5086
<BOS> She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .    24.8168
<BOS> As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen .    49.8653
<BOS> I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . " " That will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me . " " I will not be interrupted .    17.2446
<BOS> You wanted me , I know , to say ' Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .    40.0559
<BOS> When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . " " In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . " " But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr . Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . " " It is more than I engage for , I assure you . " " But consider your daughters .    25.2075
<BOS> " But what is to be done about Pemberley ? " cried Mrs .    12.0120
<BOS> The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . " To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .    56.8140
<BOS> I think I have heard you say that you know them . " " I know them a little .    17.6218
<BOS> " I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs .    5.5432
<BOS> " I am astonished , " said Miss Bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books . - - What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr . Darcy ! " " It ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations . " " And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books . " " I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . " " Neglect ! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .    21.6842
<BOS> I told my sister Philips so the other day .    45.4851
<BOS> The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .    41.1137
<BOS> I must have employment and society .    41.9677
<BOS> I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible .    43.7352
<BOS> She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .    34.2094
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . " " It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason .    29.4484
<BOS> When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .    36.9315
<BOS> But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . " " This is quite shocking ! - - He deserves to be publicly disgraced . " " Some time or other he will be - - but it shall not be by me .    20.5524
<BOS> On the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s and Mr . Darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .    35.9684
<BOS> She complained bitterly of all this to her husband .    26.1055
<BOS> As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was .    20.9149
<BOS> She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion .    37.9077
<BOS> I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .    34.6073
<BOS> Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .    47.7588
<BOS> All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .    49.2002
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " Mr . Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? " " I advise Mr . Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , " said Mrs .    24.5628
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side .    33.6959
<BOS> The possibility of meeting Mr . Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .    26.5254
<BOS> " She is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . " Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . " They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea .    25.9148
<BOS> The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news .    41.3371
<BOS> Collins ' s happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too .    66.8585
<BOS> Gardiner ' s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : " You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly .    37.8789
<BOS> Hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her .    43.6861
<BOS> She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .    35.0997
<BOS> What congratulations will then flow in ! I appeal to Mr . Darcy : - - but let me not interrupt you , Sir . - - You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . " The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .    34.9146
<BOS> I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s .    24.5070
<BOS> You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .    43.8098
<BOS> But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them .    25.2915
<BOS> He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane .    40.2441
<BOS> Gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .    20.8942
<BOS> As all conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .    44.4858
<BOS> He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite congratulation ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley ' s salutation .    33.8117
<BOS> The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way - - teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .    51.1050
<BOS> Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?    68.6211
<BOS> He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .    39.3423
<BOS> It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . " " You are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . " " How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " " And how impossible in others ! " " But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? " " That is a question which I hardly know how to answer .    23.9996
<BOS> An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn .    29.4585
<BOS> She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night .    43.8089
<BOS> Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . " * * * * * It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey .    54.6554
<BOS> The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent .    101.8203
<BOS> If it was not for the entail I should not mind it . " " What should not you mind ? " " I should not mind any thing at all . " " Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . " " I never can be thankful , Mr . Bennet , for any thing about the entail .    21.2192
<BOS> " How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say . - - You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . " " I must not decide on my own performance . " He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .    25.8774
<BOS> Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " Oh ! mamma , do the people here abouts know I am married to - day ?    41.8839
<BOS> In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .    38.7429
<BOS> The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham ' s worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .    31.8318
<BOS> He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family .    26.9720
<BOS> In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .    39.3705
<BOS> Not these two or three years perhaps . " " Write to me very often , my dear . " " As often as I can .    28.0142
<BOS> Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia .    31.2966
<BOS> She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .    26.0145
<BOS> Collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .    87.6796
<BOS> Wretched , wretched , mistake ! " Darcy made no answer .    17.9392
<BOS> More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Mr . Darcy . - - She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers . - - How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! - - Yet it did , and even a third .    43.1283
<BOS> But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .    29.3635
<BOS> Oh ! no , no , this is not likely .    23.9075
<BOS> Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .    44.4234
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror .    39.7836
<BOS> They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .    61.3189
<BOS> His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .    39.3313
<BOS> Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .    40.0555
<BOS> All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .    61.9974
<BOS> I am sure my sisters must all envy me .    30.0917
<BOS> She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her .    29.6199
<BOS> Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .    24.3962
<BOS> What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to - morrow evening .    23.6506
<BOS> Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .    28.9438
<BOS> I could hardly keep my countenance .    23.6803
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> " For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness .    22.2127
<BOS> " It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .    23.9320
<BOS> Hill and the two housemaids .    20.6583
<BOS> There ' s for you ! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ; gone to stay .    54.8101
<BOS> Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline .    36.2917
<BOS> But I confess they would have no charms for me .    17.6428
<BOS> Perhaps I am not doing her justice .    18.4551
<BOS> By you , I was properly humbled .    29.0442
<BOS> I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .    38.0919
<BOS> The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .    37.0357
<BOS> She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .    27.0745
<BOS> We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . " " I should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother .    15.7037
<BOS> Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .    27.6720
<BOS> Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .    20.1530
<BOS> Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to - night .    31.2521
<BOS> " He must be an oddity , I think , " said she .    8.2934
<BOS> You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr . Wickham ' s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .    19.9332
<BOS> I am sure you will be very comfortable there .    10.3248
<BOS> good or bad ? " " What is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . " Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .    30.2177
<BOS> The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .    18.2888
<BOS> It was in the Times and the Courier , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be .    22.7990
<BOS> She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to - - she is lost for ever . " Darcy was fixed in astonishment .    27.6519
<BOS> Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth .    12.3398
<BOS> Bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .    51.7808
<BOS> GARDINER . " The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .    27.3574
<BOS> A little time therefore . - - I shall certainly try to get the better . " With a stronger voice she soon added , " I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . " " My dear Jane ! " exclaimed Elizabeth , " you are too good .    18.3753
<BOS> Bennet and the children .    27.0762
<BOS> Mr . Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably .    27.5223
<BOS> Collins , you must send a servant with them .    22.4921
<BOS> Bennet ? " " Yes , or I will never see her again . " " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth .    20.4094
<BOS> Lady Catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .    24.4177
<BOS> In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .    53.0239
<BOS> The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more .    34.7418
<BOS> At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction .    54.0101
<BOS> " To Jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection .    21.1195
<BOS> She was going to the butcher ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed . " Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .    23.8328
<BOS> Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr . Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . - - Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .    41.1555
<BOS> She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .    45.7992
<BOS> It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy .    34.8396
<BOS> I am glad he dines here on Tuesday .    17.7554
<BOS> My dear , dear Lydia ! - - How merry we shall be together when we meet ! " Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr . Gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under .    25.6431
<BOS> She was very equal therefore to address Mr . Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .    20.2398
<BOS> As her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .    43.3767
<BOS> " There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way .    27.3679
<BOS> I knew that Mr . Wickham ought not to be a clergyman .    10.9062
<BOS> They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .    36.4806
<BOS> But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s .    21.6879
<BOS> " Oh ! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable .    26.6971
<BOS> Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay .    16.4852
<BOS> Hurst was observing their game .    55.8373
<BOS> Well , much good may it do them ! And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead .    62.3027
<BOS> No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent ' s mind .    48.2444
<BOS> You know him too well to doubt the rest .    29.8272
<BOS> They met several times , for there was much to be discussed .    19.4975
<BOS> He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . " " And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ?    44.8532
<BOS> When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . " " That is to say , you had given your permission .    23.6462
<BOS> She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .    27.8193
<BOS> She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . " Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute ,    28.8352
and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .    41.5512
<BOS> But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! - - They were excessively sorry to go ! But so they always are .    24.5478
<BOS> In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs .    27.8936
<BOS> Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .    39.6975
<BOS> Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs .    21.5187
<BOS> Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected .    27.3059
<BOS> The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr . Bingley ? " " When I am in the country , " he replied , " I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same .    15.5188
<BOS> Mr . Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .    13.4746
<BOS> But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .    41.3072
<BOS> " Good Heaven ! What is to become of us ! What are we to do ! " would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .    31.2780
<BOS> In the hall they parted .    19.7953
<BOS> Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .    47.2767
<BOS> But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .    39.0399
<BOS> He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him .    34.2739
<BOS> In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy .    26.1108
<BOS> But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London .    17.7019
<BOS> Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .    25.7205
<BOS> " Can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated .    16.5771
<BOS> His brother - in - law , Mr . Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr . Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .    30.6428
<BOS> I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .    45.4841
<BOS> Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .    21.7313
<BOS> He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .    17.7831
<BOS> But Mrs .    9.9560
<BOS> I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . " " My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you .    24.0409
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> About the Court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . " Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings .    34.4784
<BOS> Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .    35.1175
<BOS> " Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " I can answer your question , " said Fitzwilliam , " without applying to him .    22.5662
<BOS> Till this moment , I never knew myself . " From herself to Jane - - from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr . Darcy ' s explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again .    27.1835
<BOS> " We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .    25.0593
<BOS> Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .    33.9537
<BOS> The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , flowing hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .    27.6578
<BOS> was not a man to be trusted .    52.7444
<BOS> Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind ! No , no - - I feel he may defy us there .    40.6210
<BOS> They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long .    27.0174
<BOS> Anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing - room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .    27.5333
<BOS> I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .    10.9563
<BOS> It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .    42.6593
<BOS> That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible .    37.6294
<BOS> I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children . - - Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body .    22.9229
<BOS> How are they even to be discovered ?    46.3003
<BOS> And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .    59.9913
<BOS> Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? " " Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . " Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , <NUM> th October .    36.0306
<BOS> The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .    57.7683
<BOS> " What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .    34.5429
<BOS> The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention .    40.0453
<BOS> " Oh , yes ! - - if one could but go to Brighton ! But papa is so disagreeable . " " A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever . " " And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added Kitty .    22.8487
<BOS> " How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? " Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .    37.4587
<BOS> Mr . Darcy may hug himself . " " Mr . Darcy is not to be laughed at ! " cried Elizabeth .    12.0504
<BOS> His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her - - their opinion of every body - - would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable    39.2275
and pleasing .    111.8704
<BOS> He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention .    28.0563
<BOS> I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .    28.2475
<BOS> At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected .    42.6052
<BOS> She directly replied , " You need not be frightened .    29.3997
<BOS> Perhaps he thought her too young .    50.6568
<BOS> He came to tell Mr . Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr . Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once .    46.6512
<BOS> " It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . " " It is no such thing .    26.2437
<BOS> At length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book ! - - When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . " No one made any reply .    36.1722
<BOS> The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .    33.6833
<BOS> These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .    33.0744
<BOS> Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr . Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .    50.8966
<BOS> " Or in other words , you are determined to have him .    36.6288
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . " " Oh ! my dear brother , " replied Mrs .    17.7510
<BOS> " I do not blame Jane , " she continued , " for Jane would have got Mr . Bingley , if she could .    14.1883
<BOS> I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F .    19.8936
<BOS> Hope was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .    33.4909
<BOS> Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? " " I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . " " You have .    42.1968
<BOS> You have sense , and we all expect you to use it .    39.2419
<BOS> Charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility .    33.9137
<BOS> They crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered it .    49.9658
<BOS> " So , Lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love I find .    23.8864
<BOS> Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .    33.0884
<BOS> She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .    34.5405
<BOS> How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family ! When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .    45.9222
<BOS> My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .    38.9866
<BOS> Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . " As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family .    35.9437
<BOS> Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . - - We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . " " What think you of books ? " said he , smiling .    35.4851
<BOS> Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .    52.5289
<BOS> I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require . " " And I certainly never shall give it .    20.3334
<BOS> Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . " Elizabeth was distressed .    53.8622
<BOS> But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .    40.4379
<BOS> Though Lydia ' s short letter to Mrs .    12.6062
<BOS> She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished .    32.1389
<BOS> She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .    16.6691
<BOS> & c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .    27.3856
<BOS> And when I returned home , the - - - - shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time .    31.0822
<BOS> The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . " They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr . Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia .    32.9705
<BOS> I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .    30.2925
<BOS> " Mrs .    10.4658
<BOS> Her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .    42.8703
<BOS> She attracted him more than he liked - - and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself .    19.4089
<BOS> But I suppose you had no opportunity .    27.0238
<BOS> I am most seriously displeased . " Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .    24.7668
<BOS> And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .    60.0788
<BOS> She had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary .    39.6255
<BOS> It was over at last however .    28.7530
<BOS> How is such a man to be worked on ?    25.5854
<BOS> Bennet , " I am quite delighted with him .    11.7468
<BOS> Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .    45.3969
<BOS> My temper would perhaps be called resentful . - - My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . " " That is a failing indeed ! " - - cried Elizabeth .    25.7140
<BOS> It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .    37.4941
<BOS> Bennet , " and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman .    11.2227
<BOS> She answered him with cold civility .    25.6156
<BOS> I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .    29.0073
<BOS> A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .    22.2051
<BOS> It was a rational scheme to be sure ! but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .    44.0163
<BOS> It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . " " That is not an unnatural surmise , " said Fitzwilliam , " but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly . " This was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .    20.8804
<BOS> Her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .    58.1901
<BOS> Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .    23.8085
<BOS> They were hopeless of remedy .    19.9591
<BOS> so much the man of fashion ! so genteel and so easy ! - - He has always something to say to every body . - - That is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . " " Did Charlotte dine with you ? " " No , she would go home .    44.0972
<BOS> I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .    39.3822
<BOS> The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging .    28.7554
<BOS> Sir William had been delighted with him .    11.4012
<BOS> It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .    25.6702
<BOS> In as short a time as Mr . Collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .    25.7669
<BOS> Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .    35.2037
<BOS> You are a gentleman ' s daughter .    15.7097
<BOS> My sisters may write to me .    22.0778
<BOS> " Are you not diverted ? " " Oh ! yes .    9.6472
<BOS> " We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs .    25.5329
<BOS> Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .    17.9680
<BOS> I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . " " Mr . Collins moreover adds , " " I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ' s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .    41.3539
<BOS> But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging .    39.0796
<BOS> susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough .    65.2210
<BOS> She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " Ah ! Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . " It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .    36.5700
<BOS> Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . " She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .    29.2668
<BOS> " I am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she .    8.7532
<BOS> Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " Why is he so altered ?    37.8303
<BOS> I guessed as much . " And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .    31.5584
<BOS> When her mother went up to her dressing - room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .    20.9286
<BOS> Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .    55.8500
<BOS> And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information .    35.5065
<BOS> " Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .    25.4943
<BOS> She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .    31.1088
<BOS> His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances - - and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself .    28.9212
<BOS> The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .    29.7317
<BOS> He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . " Away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech .    50.8053
<BOS> Bennet .    14.5780
<BOS> Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled ! Oh ! my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " Mr . Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my love .    25.5587
<BOS> The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .    25.6841
<BOS> Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back .    19.3912
<BOS> She could think only of her letter .    19.7576
<BOS> She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .    29.7542
<BOS> Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing - room .    18.7063
<BOS> " Upon my word , " said Mrs .    5.2253
<BOS> Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , " Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .    23.7815
<BOS> As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner .    25.3892
<BOS> But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .    18.8795
<BOS> Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! It is admirable ! " Elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .    35.6398
<BOS> Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all .    34.8211
<BOS> I see the imprudence of it . - - Oh ! that abominable Mr . Darcy ! - - My father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to forfeit it .    17.7399
<BOS> " About a month , " said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . " " Yes , " replied Wickham ; - - " his estate there is a noble one .    19.0733
<BOS> Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously .    39.5176
<BOS> Mr . Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .    13.8978
<BOS> She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater - - what shall I call it ?    29.2459
<BOS> Again she read on .    48.9016
<BOS> She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of Mr . Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings .    25.1229
<BOS> He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . " " And my mother - - How is she ?    28.3793
<BOS> Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives .    42.6080
<BOS> Mr . Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , - - " This walk is not wide enough for our party .    43.9513
<BOS> Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .    35.6911
<BOS> But that gentleman , " looking at Darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . " " Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , " said Elizabeth , blushing for her mother .    18.5017
<BOS> It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .    35.3843
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> He has the promise of an ensigncy in General - - - - ' s regiment , now quartered in the North .    18.4910
<BOS> The tumult of her mind was now painfully great .    17.5306
<BOS> In a doleful voice Mrs .    15.7067
<BOS> Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object .    26.3854
<BOS> Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . " " Are you quite sure , Ma ' am ? - - is not there a little mistake ? " said Jane . - - " I certainly saw Mr . Darcy speaking to her . " " Aye - - because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; - - but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . " " Miss Bingley told me , " said Jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .    30.1178
<BOS> After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard .    43.7108
<BOS> Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .    29.1803
<BOS> Good girl ! It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley ' s pretended regard . " " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . " This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .    29.4147
<BOS> Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .    32.3521
<BOS> I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother .    27.7046
<BOS> Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . " No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .    31.3755
<BOS> " If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it would not make them one jot less agreeable . " " But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy .    28.4091
<BOS> It is too long ago .    23.3422
<BOS> She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .    33.4706
<BOS> Is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?    49.8486
<BOS> He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .    38.6942
<BOS> " But so we all do .    24.9026
<BOS> I will only add , God bless you .    40.4994
<BOS> But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .    31.0511
<BOS> As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .    36.8179
<BOS> She was wild to be at home - - to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .    42.5671
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body .    37.3135
<BOS> If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November <NUM> th , by four o ' clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se ' night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .    48.9296
<BOS> Your uncle is as much surprised as I am - - and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .    27.4003
<BOS> For your sake , " turning to Charlotte , " I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . - - It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh ' s family . - - Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? " " A little . " " Oh ! then - - some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .    21.0461
<BOS> The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .    29.3031
<BOS> But you do not know all .    10.2778
<BOS> Never , since reading Jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham ' s meaning to marry her .    27.3783
<BOS> But , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . " " Undoubtedly , " replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .    30.7824
<BOS> He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .    43.7842
<BOS> " If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . - - I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .    24.3887
<BOS> No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .    33.2504
<BOS> The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon .    49.7202
<BOS> He studies too much for words of four syllables . - - Do not you , Darcy ? " " My style of writing is very different from yours . " " Oh ! " cried Miss Bingley , " Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .    25.3778
<BOS> He arranges the business just as he pleases . " " And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .    29.8470
<BOS> She will follow wherever Lydia leads .    92.4874
<BOS> There can be no occasion for your going so soon .    24.5367
<BOS> " I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . " Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .    29.3242
<BOS> " FITZWILLIAM DARCY . " If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .    19.5206
<BOS> Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?    50.1877
<BOS> I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all - - and now despise me if you dare . " " Indeed I do not dare . " Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .    25.6045
<BOS> Five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs .    22.6975
<BOS> It became her turn to listen .    32.4194
<BOS> If you love Mr . Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .    21.9885
<BOS> Both sisters were uncomfortable enough .    24.9888
<BOS> And what do you think she said besides ?    41.4617
<BOS> He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . " " Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .    29.6456
<BOS> His disposition must be dreadful . " " I will not trust myself on the subject , " replied Wickham , " I can hardly be just to him . " Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " To treat in such a manner , the god - son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! " - - She could have added , " A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " - - but she contented herself with " And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the    35.2902
closest manner ! " " We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .    38.0853
<BOS> Jane was beyond competition her favourite child .    55.4578
<BOS> " Well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " I have no more to say .    8.5612
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Let me hear what it is . " " We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .    15.8728
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .    26.3397
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! - - Imagine our surprise .    43.8091
<BOS> Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .    15.5132
<BOS> There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .    44.0566
<BOS> Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken .    24.0542
<BOS> In spite of her deeply - rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .    30.5758
<BOS> We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word .    33.9297
<BOS> I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you . " " It is evident by this , " added Jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . " " It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should . " " Why will you think so ?    27.7565
<BOS> She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr . Darcy , she was directly retreating .    25.1946
<BOS> First of all , he asked Miss Lucas .    31.8432
<BOS> I have no such injuries to resent .    22.5894
<BOS> I hardly know how Mr . Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . " " You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr . Darcy . " " No , indeed , I did not . - - I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine ' s connections .    27.1681
<BOS> And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . " " Indeed , Mr . Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .    25.1861
<BOS> Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .    22.8419
<BOS> I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .    18.5404
<BOS> They found Mr . Bennet still up .    28.3062
<BOS> That Mr . Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Mr . Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings .    26.0300
<BOS> " Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .    25.5083
<BOS> If this be the case , he deserves you .    25.7992
<BOS> " A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .    36.5718
<BOS> Mr . Collins was eloquent in her praise .    12.9615
<BOS> There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town .    23.4440
<BOS> They followed her into the dining - parlour .    12.2943
<BOS> It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say nothing of that .    24.2400
<BOS> I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . " " It is well .    24.1658
<BOS> Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . " " To yield readily - - easily - - to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you . " " To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . " " You appear to me , Mr . Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .    35.9127
<BOS> " Wickham so very bad ! It is almost past belief .    103.1722
<BOS> But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish - - and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . - - Here you are in your own family . " " Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield .    27.3484
<BOS> I have not the smallest hope .    17.7425
<BOS> Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .    30.9453
<BOS> Reynolds ' s respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .    31.0264
<BOS> Not that I care about it , though .    40.9937
<BOS> They had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister .    47.8809
<BOS> Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr . Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .    48.9727
<BOS> Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .    66.0503
<BOS> " He is as fine a fellow , " said Mr . Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever I saw .    14.9838
<BOS> It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .    25.5800
<BOS> His countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips .    51.1277
<BOS> Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr . Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .    30.5941
<BOS> The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .    24.4366
<BOS> At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . " " I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .    24.7134
<BOS> Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . " " But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .    39.4306
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July , and must be in London again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire .    44.5784
<BOS> Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself .    34.5341
<BOS> At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs .    17.9127
<BOS> This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .    39.9656
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> The first part of Mrs .    9.9907
<BOS> Astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .    29.8420
<BOS> He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed .    26.4216
<BOS> You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these .    36.4844
<BOS> Lord ! how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls .    41.6444
<BOS> It needed all Jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .    65.9044
<BOS> A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .    91.7362
<BOS> When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr . Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a duel .    32.5177
<BOS> Mr . Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .    27.4263
<BOS> Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over .    30.4960
<BOS> " How despicably have I acted ! " she cried . - - " I , who have prided myself on my discernment ! - - I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust . - - How humiliating is this discovery ! - - Yet , how just a humiliation ! - - Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind .    36.7374
<BOS> Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it .    22.3896
<BOS> When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .    38.8132
<BOS> He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ' s daughter ; so far we are equal . " " True .    23.5904
<BOS> They were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of Mrs .    26.1886
<BOS> Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty .    34.7514
<BOS> After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her - - " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? " She smiled , but made no answer .    32.5922
<BOS> She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .    37.8404
<BOS> We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . " " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him .    24.4392
<BOS> It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn .    32.1532
<BOS> Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .    29.6992
<BOS> " I will go to Meryton , " said she , " as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips .    18.4446
<BOS> How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! Who would have thought of my meeting with - - perhaps - - a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! - - I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .    39.3794
<BOS> Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .    20.8087
<BOS> He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me .    20.5733
<BOS> When first Mr . Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son .    40.2183
<BOS> No , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr . Collins in time . " The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret .    33.7658
<BOS> He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question - - of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father ' s intentions .    40.0610
<BOS> He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . " " Elizabeth , you are not serious now . " " I beg your pardon .    12.8973
<BOS> It cannot be concealed from any one .    19.2577
<BOS> I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . " To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .    29.2369
<BOS> The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .    58.5829
<BOS> I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .    38.6396
<BOS> We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome .    69.4720
<BOS> I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . " And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " Oh ! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable .    33.7815
<BOS> My mind was more agreeably engaged .    39.9702
<BOS> The Lucases are very artful people indeed , sister .    47.2932
<BOS> In a few minutes , Mrs .    9.1087
<BOS> Very nonsensical to come at all ! Why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?    49.9619
<BOS> My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . " " I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own . " Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .    27.6840
<BOS> But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . " " Has she been presented ?    31.4494
<BOS> They were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .    23.3074
<BOS> She had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .    32.3870
<BOS> As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .    39.6015
<BOS> He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . " " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them - - by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . " " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must disarm reproof . " " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility .    28.4146
<BOS> Painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled .    36.8149
<BOS> " Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? " " His misfortunes ! " repeated Darcy contemptuously ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . " " And of your infliction , " cried Elizabeth with energy .    31.9723
<BOS> After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr . Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball .    37.4161
<BOS> Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .    61.6266
<BOS> " I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . " " You shall hear then - - but prepare yourself for something very dreadful .    41.4175
<BOS> This is my advice .    31.8790
<BOS> I came to you without a doubt of my reception .    24.8010
<BOS> Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s .    17.9477
<BOS> As they drove to Mr . Gardiner ' s door , Jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .    30.0011
<BOS> She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false ! This cannot be ! This must be the grossest falsehood ! " - - and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .    27.1792
<BOS> Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine ' s visit .    52.2685
<BOS> Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant ' s commission in the - - - - shire .    25.1288
<BOS> Mr . Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .    23.2796
<BOS> Kitty , run down and order the carriage .    44.7591
<BOS> Mr . Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .    46.7121
<BOS> Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people ' s remarks . " Elizabeth did not know what to make of it .    19.6895
<BOS> On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . - - It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome . - - She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .    35.0760
<BOS> Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; - - but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy . - - Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs .    35.5901
<BOS> It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .    23.1955
<BOS> " What would she have said ? - - how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself .    39.5244
<BOS> He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ' s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .    36.3261
<BOS> Reynolds was of no trifling nature .    62.1445
<BOS> One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . " " I never thought Mr . Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . " " And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .    28.5599
<BOS> I dare say I shall soon see them here . " Elizabeth shook her head over this letter .    17.5295
<BOS> Wickham will never marry a woman without some money .    40.9685
<BOS> Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs .    24.9210
<BOS> The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth .    36.9220
<BOS> I dare say the lace upon Mrs .    22.0759
<BOS> She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by Wickham .    32.4001
<BOS> I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . " " And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . " " It did .    33.1964
<BOS> Will you come and see me ? " " We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . " " I am not likely to leave Kent for some time .    22.0427
<BOS> On their being joined by Mr . Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr . Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .    32.4106
<BOS> She had a sister married to a Mr . Philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade .    32.6260
<BOS> It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both - - - - " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! " Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both .    25.8614
<BOS> I did for you .    24.0281
<BOS> It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your ' s seems to have been .    42.8078
<BOS> She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .    31.0445
<BOS> Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me .    44.4028
<BOS> I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend , WILLIAM COLLINS . " " At four o ' clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman , " said Mr . Bennet , as he folded up the letter .    27.1199
<BOS> This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr . Wickham .    22.3021
<BOS> I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .    25.0827
<BOS> You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage .    35.2703
<BOS> " My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .    18.7758
<BOS> She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .    34.0826
<BOS> I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .    29.0359
<BOS> Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .    12.8088
<BOS> But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?    24.0887
<BOS> Bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone .    19.4052
<BOS> Mr . Darcy , you cannot deny the fact . " " I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . " " True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .    28.1987
<BOS> At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .    46.2980
<BOS> He drew a chair near her .    28.3647
<BOS> The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing .    35.7775
<BOS> Lady Catherine was generally speaking - - stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .    31.8507
<BOS> Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane .    35.3462
<BOS> Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from P .    21.6462
<BOS> A thousand things may arise in six months ! " The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .    44.7370
<BOS> But her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came .    52.0693
<BOS> She was shewn into the breakfast - parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . - - That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs .    25.7682
<BOS> Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .    51.9833
<BOS> She then took a large house in Edward - street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .    32.0534
<BOS> But the case is this .    23.5702
<BOS> Poor Charlotte ! - - it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! - - But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .    27.7472
<BOS> The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him .    20.8942
<BOS> Gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .    26.4611
<BOS> Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .    32.6622
<BOS> Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr . and Mrs .    11.0500
<BOS> The apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts .    27.8482
<BOS> Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .    35.5747
<BOS> She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality - - deliberated on the probability of each statement - - but with little success .    27.7111
<BOS> Gardiner .    26.0506
<BOS> You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be dissuaded from it .    34.3784
<BOS> It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it .    31.5647
<BOS> Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .    40.6639
<BOS> To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .    21.4825
<BOS> " Does that young lady know Mr . Darcy ? " Elizabeth coloured , and said - - " A little . " " And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma ' am ? " " Yes , very handsome . " " I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .    20.9829
<BOS> She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .    24.8248
<BOS> It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .    24.9884
<BOS> It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter - day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .    31.7249
<BOS> She wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .    45.3608
<BOS> Lydia was Lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .    33.7297
<BOS> It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning .    24.7247
<BOS> " MY DEAR BROTHER , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction .    23.4673
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> But the gloom of Lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs .    21.9903
<BOS> " I found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr . Darcy ; - - that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . " She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .    29.2499
<BOS> I wonder what he can be doing there . " " Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , " said Elizabeth .    19.3520
<BOS> You have liked many a stupider person . " " Dear Lizzy ! " " Oh ! you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general .    23.3974
<BOS> Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .    29.8461
<BOS> And one of my own daughters .    21.4107
<BOS> In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . " Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .    32.1377
<BOS> When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte .    38.5477
<BOS> " Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam .    11.9312
<BOS> She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr . Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle - piece .    30.0773
<BOS> He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday .    32.2182
<BOS> He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting .    18.3245
<BOS> From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .    28.5365
<BOS> Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so - - but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .    32.2056
<BOS> He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . " " Good heavens ! " cried Elizabeth ; " but how could that be ? - - How could his will be disregarded ? - - Why did not you seek legal redress ? " " There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .    29.1333
<BOS> But that is nothing to us .    17.8311
<BOS> They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are .    27.2727
<BOS> You cannot have been always at Longbourn . " Elizabeth looked surprised .    20.5452
<BOS> " I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring .    8.5257
<BOS> But I hope you will not mind it : it is all for Jane ' s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .    27.2174
<BOS> His appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .    31.6346
<BOS> Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .    24.4999
<BOS> I am prodigiously proud of him .    23.2225
<BOS> The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience .    29.3469
<BOS> " This is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can , - - or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty runs away . " " I am not going to run away , Papa , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . " " You go to Brighton ! - - I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for    26.8913
fifty pounds ! No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .    15.8831
<BOS> The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw .    48.8847
<BOS> Does he know his real character ? " " I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .    38.2914
<BOS> You refuse , then , to oblige me .    25.4835
<BOS> Your tempers are by no means unlike .    29.5915
<BOS> Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast - room .    22.8756
<BOS> Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .    30.4333
<BOS> He did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September , than any body else in the country .    24.5740
<BOS> When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr . Bingley . - - It was an animating subject , and Mrs .    32.6055
<BOS> Gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .    32.2420
<BOS> The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way .    44.0681
<BOS> Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .    52.6147
<BOS> They attacked him in various ways ; with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas .    36.3878
<BOS> Mr . Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .    17.0790
<BOS> " My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ' s regard for me .    24.4723
<BOS> It was a journey of only twenty - four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch - street by noon .    34.5049
<BOS> Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true .    39.7685
<BOS> His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .    26.9265
<BOS> Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . " " If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . " " She is a very good kind of girl , I believe .    20.2530
<BOS> It was my brother Gardiner ' s drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .    36.6041
<BOS> Who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ? " Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal ! As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty ' s and Lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it .    33.3000
<BOS> " How could I ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face .    20.9443
<BOS> Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr . Darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .    53.8149
<BOS> Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate - - but on this point it will be as well to be silent .    34.3878
<BOS> I am quite well .    12.7986
<BOS> The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .    74.5935
<BOS> Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure .    24.6230
<BOS> She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .    25.8845
<BOS> We passed each other several times .    63.5414
<BOS> Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .    40.6963
<BOS> She enquired into Charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her ' s , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .    27.4483
<BOS> And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! Oh ! how I wanted you ! " " How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr . Darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved . " " Certainly .    41.4585
<BOS> She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley ' s two sisters .    70.5000
<BOS> Change of scene might be of service - - and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . " Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready acquiescence .    45.4094
<BOS> " You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! Unfeeling , selfish girl ! Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " " Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say .    29.8009
<BOS> The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected .    28.2668
<BOS> My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart .    54.5300
<BOS> I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .    29.3706
<BOS> It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .    38.9786
<BOS> Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery .    63.8918
<BOS> But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .    52.0802
<BOS> Her report was highly favourable .    40.7217
<BOS> Mr . Darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .    30.9961
<BOS> You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice .    56.6253
<BOS> Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .    32.9415
<BOS> Bennet followed her , saying , " I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .    27.4106
<BOS> Mr . and Mrs .    7.9074
<BOS> They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane ' s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super - excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .    33.0185
<BOS> Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology , " " Hunsford , " and " Lady Catherine de Bourgh . " - - It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .    31.7354
<BOS> Mr . Robinson ' s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?    31.5823
<BOS> I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him .    28.9678
<BOS> The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte ' s dying an old maid .    62.2017
<BOS> It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se ' night . " Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . - - Mr . Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , "    37.5894
My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom - - provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .    45.4956
<BOS> There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s frailty would have mortified her so much .    36.9114
<BOS> I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane - - one does not often see any body better looking .    38.1657
<BOS> Very odd ! - - And you only the second . - - The younger ones out before the elder are married ! - - Your younger sisters must be very young ? " " Yes , my youngest is not sixteen .    33.3811
<BOS> After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re - considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .    40.7212
<BOS> It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch - street , for the town of - - - - in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr . Bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ' s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room up stairs .    25.8866
<BOS> Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .    34.0462
<BOS> oh ! no . " " I can much more easily believe Mr . Bingley ' s being imposed on , than that Mr . Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony . - - If it be not so , let Mr . Darcy contradict it .    29.4542
<BOS> Human nature is so prone to fall into it ! No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame .    35.5120
<BOS> Mr . Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , & c .    15.8975
<BOS> The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles .    74.7270
<BOS> You have no compassion on my poor nerves . " " You mistake me , my dear .    15.7300
<BOS> They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .    40.7357
<BOS> " But surely , " said she , " I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . " The period of expectation was now doubled .    24.3174
<BOS> Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . " The colour now rushed into Elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " You look conscious .    29.2029
<BOS> But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant .    30.4618
<BOS> On Mr . and Mrs .    10.4319
<BOS> Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy .    43.2638
<BOS> Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .    43.6480
<BOS> But pride - - where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation . " Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .    33.1563
<BOS> If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed .    42.7512
<BOS> Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " " Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .    28.7682
<BOS> The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her .    13.4704
<BOS> They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .    44.7060
<BOS> She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .    23.9736
<BOS> Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs .    38.9085
<BOS> Bennet , was not so well pleased with it .    14.7396
<BOS> The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .    29.1822
<BOS> Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .    36.9512
<BOS> I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again .    26.3569
<BOS> He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . - - But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . - - To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .    44.5372
<BOS> Mr . Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .    17.3792
<BOS> By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration .    38.8598
<BOS> If , indeed , it should be so ! But I dare not hope it .    26.3436
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s .    33.7226
<BOS> Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth ' s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste .    36.5233
<BOS> Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr . Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , endurable to Kitty and Lydia .    37.8849
<BOS> There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .    34.5122
<BOS> Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .    28.2406
<BOS> " It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ' s . " " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west . " Mrs .    23.1511
<BOS> We were always good friends ; and now we are better . " " True .    17.1221
<BOS> Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?    31.1315
<BOS> When the tea - things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother ' s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .    24.9241
<BOS> Wont it , Kitty ? " Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .    37.0565
<BOS> Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy .    16.2190
<BOS> One enjoyment was certain - - that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences - - cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure - - and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .    61.8449
<BOS> " And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " " I will make no promise of the kind . " " Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished .    36.4851
<BOS> With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield .    28.8431
<BOS> Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .    61.9264
<BOS> " I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox ! Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .    29.8801
<BOS> I wish I could see her .    18.9543
<BOS> He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .    13.7805
<BOS> I knew how it would be .    13.5737
<BOS> " He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .    30.0892
<BOS> What do you keep winking at me for ?    43.2242
<BOS> Respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .    31.9275
<BOS> I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them .    42.5819
<BOS> It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .    31.5744
<BOS> The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s . - - Do you draw ? " " No , not at all . " " What , none of you ? " " Not one . " " That is very strange .    21.0734
<BOS> It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family ; - - and as she considered that Jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .    24.7167
<BOS> I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun . " " My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners - - my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .    35.5402
<BOS> There can be no love in all this .    22.5011
<BOS> Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter .    31.9559
<BOS> He then said , " I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .    31.0765
<BOS> They were in - - - - street .    14.2802
<BOS> She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .    26.1697
<BOS> Charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .    32.7296
<BOS> Thank Heaven ! he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . " Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .    23.9541
<BOS> To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .    49.5382
<BOS> Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , " Good Lord ! Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? - - Do not you know that Mr . Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? " Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but Sir William ' s good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .    36.6335
<BOS> * * * * * " Good gracious ! " cried Mrs .    5.3874
<BOS> He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .    35.9787
<BOS> " I want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about Mr . Wickham .    18.3757
<BOS> At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .    26.9217
<BOS> Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .    25.0347
<BOS> Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . " " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , - - splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .    46.7759
<BOS> Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano - forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance .    40.6355
<BOS> I believe him to be Lady Catherine ' s nephew .    15.5845
<BOS> But do not imagine that he is always here so often .    19.4137
<BOS> To no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .    47.4578
<BOS> I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on .    37.0643
<BOS> The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine ' s drawing - room .    19.9815
<BOS> At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted - - - - " He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other .    26.6479
<BOS> Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .    36.9424
<BOS> As for their mother , Mr . Collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill - will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .    24.7273
<BOS> Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married .    44.7030
<BOS> Let me hear from you very soon .    29.1266
<BOS> " And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . " " I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . " Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .    24.2326
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .    37.8424
<BOS> Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .    68.0173
<BOS> As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .    32.3778
<BOS> It was a large , well - proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .    21.4673
<BOS> The very last evening was spent there ; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .    49.0257
<BOS> He now wished it more than ever .    38.2247
<BOS> Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now .    22.9425
<BOS> Supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?    36.2072
<BOS> " Yours , & c . " " Well , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr . Bingley , and under your orders . " " Oh ! I am not at all afraid of her dying .    14.2767
<BOS> I do not believe she often sees such at home . " " The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . " Mrs .    27.4698
<BOS> The adieu is charity itself .    35.0747
<BOS> " Very well . - - That reply will do for the present . - - Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . - - But now we may be silent . " " Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " Sometimes .    46.9999
<BOS> Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .    35.6917
<BOS> The pause was to Elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful .    29.2898
<BOS> The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men .    27.7087
<BOS> " They have both , " said she , " been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .    21.5203
<BOS> They were , therefore , to go . - - Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .    18.3678
<BOS> She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .    39.1677
<BOS> " And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ! Oh , that I knew how it was ! " But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .    57.3324
<BOS> The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .    30.6987
<BOS> They now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought .    47.9264
<BOS> His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .    33.8940
<BOS> Perhaps she is full young to be much in company .    68.7273
<BOS> Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting - woman was in it .    32.6214
<BOS> Widely different was the effect of a second perusal . - - How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? - - He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister ' s attachment ; - - and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ' s opinion had always been . - - Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . - - She felt that Jane ' s feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility .    25.6279
<BOS> When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .    36.6754
<BOS> I think she will be pleased with the hermitage . " Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .    24.0129
<BOS> But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .    32.6263
<BOS> Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .    41.2389
<BOS> In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .    27.9184
<BOS> But your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .    26.9506
<BOS> The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .    42.6473
<BOS> She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .    60.7158
<BOS> I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . " " Oh ! if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better .    21.3336
<BOS> My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this .    44.5424
<BOS> But these things happen so often ! A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . " " An excellent consolation in its way , " said Elizabeth , " but it will not do for us .    22.6120
<BOS> " What could he mean ?    18.4978
<BOS> It was the last of the regiment ' s stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .    18.1939
<BOS> Miss Bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room .    37.4604
<BOS> " ' Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he .    22.6961
<BOS> Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . - - Against staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively resolved - - nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .    41.4809
<BOS> When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs .    44.5062
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend .    19.4638
<BOS> He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information .    38.0303
<BOS> Don ' t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .    35.0615
<BOS> But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .    22.5251
<BOS> Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .    31.2879
<BOS> There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .    21.9312
<BOS> They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better .    61.2270
<BOS> At length , she spoke again .    14.4314
<BOS> Elizabeth was now to see Mr . Wickham for the last time .    16.6541
<BOS> I congratulate her .    20.3157
<BOS> But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?    26.5913
<BOS> On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .    24.5755
<BOS> It is useless to talk of it . " It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .    27.7337
<BOS> After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer .    37.7372
<BOS> In short , I will do my best . " " Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .    22.6414
<BOS> DEAR SIR , The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance . - - " There , Mrs .    38.6393
<BOS> He knows where we live .    62.8162
<BOS> She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips ' s .    25.9752
<BOS> Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth ' s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s .    15.7634
<BOS> You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas .    25.5636
<BOS> They came .    34.6733
<BOS> Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . " Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . - - Others of the party were now applied to .    28.7019
<BOS> They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .    31.1263
<BOS> She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .    38.1576
<BOS> The vicious propensities - - the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr . Darcy could not have .    24.7859
<BOS> To the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr . Bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer .    25.0319
<BOS> Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs .    17.0445
<BOS> You have a sweet room here , Mr . Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .    31.7787
<BOS> One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , " Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe .    19.9644
<BOS> Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .    32.6697
<BOS> Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very innocently said , " What is the matter mamma ?    32.0258
<BOS> Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . - - If it be so , if I have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .    28.1636
<BOS> If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .    24.2180
<BOS> " Did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ?    18.2933
<BOS> The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country .    29.5347
<BOS> Philips ' s manners and politeness .    15.8741
<BOS> What is your own opinion ? " " That it ought not to be attempted .    13.9707
<BOS> We neither of us perform to strangers . " Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .    22.0108
<BOS> Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?    43.7470
<BOS> Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy .    30.8696
<BOS> Yes , yes .    22.9527
<BOS> He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .    28.5296
<BOS> Every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to Charlotte ' s first sketch .    23.6297
<BOS> The business was therefore soon settled .    24.8693
<BOS> At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .    54.9164
<BOS> I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former .    16.9214
<BOS> " ' Tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much .    19.6972
<BOS> My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better .    31.9895
<BOS> To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh ?    21.9016
<BOS> " Yet why did he come ? " She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .    26.6539
<BOS> She has known him only a fortnight .    18.4323
<BOS> But to be candid without ostentation or design - - to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad - - belongs to you alone .    28.5265
<BOS> In such an exigence my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness . " " Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? " cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared .    18.3386
<BOS> " Oh , Jane , take care . " " My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . " " I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . " * * * * * They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ; and Mrs .    16.2335
<BOS> But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled .    33.9072
<BOS> If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him .    16.3739
<BOS> There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .    20.6471
<BOS> The children have been wanting me this half hour .    40.8553
<BOS> When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . " " Your plan is a good one , " replied Elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it .    21.8035
<BOS> Excuse me - - for I must speak plainly .    30.1700
<BOS> Your mother insists upon your accepting it .    27.6755
<BOS> The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .    67.4903
<BOS> Gardiner smiled .    30.3691
<BOS> " It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on .    23.6102
<BOS> Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . " He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .    31.4169
<BOS> Their visits to Mrs .    15.1339
<BOS> I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .    46.7345
<BOS> The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her - - that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right .    27.3588
<BOS> Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .    24.1942
<BOS> Gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .    28.0108
<BOS> That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny .    39.3815
<BOS> Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .    22.6038
<BOS> Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .    28.3493
<BOS> Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .    33.0170
<BOS> His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire .    40.5513
<BOS> But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault - - because I would not take the trouble of practising .    18.2747
<BOS> They then went away .    11.6570
<BOS> In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .    27.8990
<BOS> His words seemed to imply it .    25.1726
<BOS> She went on .    24.8050
<BOS> Gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face .    27.6398
<BOS> A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self - importance and humility .    32.8283
<BOS> The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and    46.0392
finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .    35.4857
<BOS> I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him .    27.8321
<BOS> The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .    33.8097
<BOS> I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . - - These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . " " You judge very properly , " said Mr . Bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .    30.1894
<BOS> The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . " " I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head .    33.7069
<BOS> The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn .    33.0048
<BOS> " Your examination of Mr . Darcy is over , I presume , " said Miss Bingley ; - - " and pray what is the result ? " " I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr . Darcy has no defect .    13.8803
<BOS> " I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I ever met with .    22.8280
<BOS> Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .    44.4283
<BOS> She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self - conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .    34.6458
<BOS> What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing ' s Park , when he put his letter into her hand ! She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .    46.9708
<BOS> As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .    60.3077
<BOS> " I am sorry it went off .    19.4962
<BOS> How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you . " Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .    29.4369
<BOS> But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .    45.6483
<BOS> But I must write no more .    12.7066
<BOS> This Mrs .    26.1578
<BOS> They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market - town , where the family did not visit .    31.7458
<BOS> Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy .    33.4104
<BOS> Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .    12.0816
<BOS> Lady Catherine de Bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .    20.3754
<BOS> Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . " " And do you impute it to either of those ? " " Yes ; to the last .    25.8911
<BOS> Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .    21.3344
<BOS> Now is your time .    32.5649
<BOS> Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .    41.6559
<BOS> Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .    25.8930
<BOS> " How can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . " " I shall be very fit to see Jane - - which is all I want . " " Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? " " No , indeed .    13.4378
<BOS> She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr . Darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .    31.9883
<BOS> Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .    36.3563
<BOS> She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs .    23.4359
<BOS> He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again .    10.8592
<BOS> If he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .    40.8245
<BOS> Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .    47.2832
<BOS> Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings .    21.7199
<BOS> Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .    23.6647
<BOS> You are not well enough ; - - you cannot go yourself . " Elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .    17.1817
<BOS> But why Mr . Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .    20.2162
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> And what sort of young lady is she ?    24.6722
<BOS> But I will not repine .    11.9967
<BOS> His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion .    25.6568
<BOS> Jenkinson , who lives with them .    18.2499
<BOS> Indeed he has no improper pride .    40.6078
<BOS> They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .    26.1272
<BOS> Collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl .    21.0790
<BOS> What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?    69.1524
<BOS> For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him .    29.7219
<BOS> At present I will say nothing about it . " " You are quite right .    14.0876
<BOS> Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining - parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr . Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement .    39.3088
<BOS> He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley .    18.3481
<BOS> Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .    48.4720
<BOS> She will be taken good care of .    48.6462
<BOS> Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it .    27.2886
<BOS> As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper .    45.9170
<BOS> You know my sentiments . " " You are then resolved to have him ? " " I have said no such thing .    18.1208
<BOS> Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence .    85.0031
<BOS> Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .    48.1175
<BOS> They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .    33.7519
<BOS> Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins ' s correspondence for any consideration .    35.7956
<BOS> Forster .    22.8640
<BOS> Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .    27.4352
<BOS> And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . " " Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " " Perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister .    30.1192
<BOS> Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . " " But my father cannot . - - He wrote last week to hurry my return . " " Oh ! your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . - - Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .    31.1032
<BOS> Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .    30.9366
<BOS> The supposition did not pain her .    27.1115
<BOS> And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry .    35.9637
<BOS> Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .    41.1706
<BOS> After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .    21.9762
<BOS> She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse .    25.5290
<BOS> Elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion .    29.6874
<BOS> Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your ' s .    24.9498
<BOS> Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that I despair .    30.1181
<BOS> Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .    42.1124
<BOS> Elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .    42.6060
<BOS> Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self - destined to another .    48.3598
<BOS> Charlotte herself was tolerably composed .    64.2681
<BOS> Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs .    42.1175
<BOS> It was then disclosed in the following manner .    18.8583
<BOS> We can all begin freely - - a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .    56.5449
<BOS> He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman - like man , asked her how she had liked him .    30.2820
<BOS> When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .    34.3942
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .    30.8533
<BOS> She had always felt that Charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .    29.7544
<BOS> After a short pause , her companion added , " You are too generous to trifle with me .    16.2259
<BOS> The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .    47.0924
<BOS> But it is of small importance . " " I might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?    37.9165
<BOS> Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of - - or I may say , three very silly sisters .    44.0522
<BOS> I have certainly meant well through the whole affair .    43.7612
<BOS> Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane ' s beauty .    49.9799
<BOS> It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her ' s .    20.5926
<BOS> " And they are really to be married ! " cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .    10.0473
<BOS> But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . " Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .    38.5546
<BOS> Younge was of course removed from her charge .    31.1868
<BOS> Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?    99.4444
<BOS> Bennet rang the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library .    20.0202
<BOS> Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes .    30.3512
<BOS> In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .    39.0612
<BOS> I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well - informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .    33.6061
<BOS> The others have been gone on to Scarborough , these three weeks . " She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .    21.2841
<BOS> And to be kept back on such a motive ! - - I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . " " Upon my word , " said her Ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . - - Pray , what is your age ? " " With three younger sisters grown up , " replied Elizabeth smiling , " your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . " Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .    26.9814
<BOS> " But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , " replied her uncle .    20.3483
<BOS> Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano - forte in Mrs .    27.4101
<BOS> " Of what are you talking ? " " Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy .    20.4291
<BOS> Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .    30.5400
<BOS> We have not met since the <NUM> th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . " Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn .    33.7296
<BOS> " Did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " " From the former .    24.6807
<BOS> She must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .    61.1801
<BOS> Eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress .    24.1282
<BOS> Lydia , my love , ring the bell .    30.7200
<BOS> The visit was returned in due form .    43.4332
<BOS> But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so .    32.8433
<BOS> She saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .    29.7403
<BOS> For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse . " It was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from Jane .    18.1660
<BOS> Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .    22.7452
<BOS> Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Mr . Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton .    31.8694
<BOS> " I did not think Caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London .    22.9199
<BOS> They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs .    17.1500
<BOS> The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr . Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr . Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter .    17.1521
<BOS> I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . " Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .    23.7644
<BOS> " Then , who taught you ?    28.7481
<BOS> I cannot understand it .    11.3719
<BOS> No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .    23.4684
<BOS> You must learn some of my philosophy .    26.9343
<BOS> The moral will be perfectly fair .    21.2250
<BOS> I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance .    26.9693
<BOS> never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F .    40.1365
<BOS> She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .    33.0069
<BOS> To know that her daughter would be married was enough .    22.4238
<BOS> There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs .    33.7120
<BOS> Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .    26.3059
<BOS> Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .    29.1766
<BOS> There was also a postscript to this effect .    21.0548
<BOS> To Mr . Bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .    17.1743
<BOS> Her mind was less difficult to develope .    17.0357
<BOS> He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .    18.0081
<BOS> Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .    28.3827
<BOS> But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .    15.6152
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> In pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton .    25.7094
<BOS> " EDW .    12.4304
<BOS> I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .    32.0020
<BOS> They soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr . and Mrs .    11.1835
<BOS> Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; - - and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt - - for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .    32.4774
<BOS> She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous .    49.9159
<BOS> Dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster ' s .    36.1801
<BOS> Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .    24.6162
<BOS> And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs .    24.9346
<BOS> Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn .    33.8977
<BOS> It was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ; - - and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .    25.8236
<BOS> And then when we came away it was such fun ! I thought we never should have got into the coach .    33.4786
<BOS> The room in which the ladies sat was backwards .    43.7295
<BOS> After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " It is your turn to say something now , Mr . Darcy . - - I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . " He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .    26.1372
<BOS> She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham .    28.2497
<BOS> While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them .    26.7390
<BOS> Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth ! What do I not owe you ! You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous .    69.9591
<BOS> Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .    27.2850
<BOS> " How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr . Darcy , " she cried ; " I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .    31.0563
<BOS> It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . " " But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea .    35.9657
<BOS> But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .    25.5286
<BOS> I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you . " Elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .    29.1279
<BOS> This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .    49.7921
<BOS> This letter is from Mr . Collins . " " From Mr . Collins ! and what can he have to say ? " " Something very much to the purpose of course .    17.7653
<BOS> I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my dinners are good enough for her .    39.2336
<BOS> Dear , dear Lizzy .    28.1389
<BOS> All connection between us seemed now dissolved .    71.0740
<BOS> There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . " " I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . " " Oh , well ! it is just as he chooses .    20.5930
<BOS> I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .    22.1685
<BOS> Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of Bingley ' s behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .    28.1452
<BOS> Bennet ' s sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .    32.3235
<BOS> You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him .    18.5188
<BOS> She enquired after his sister , but could do no more .    25.0720
<BOS> Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .    57.0591
<BOS> ' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? " " Yes , Ma ' am , all . " " All ! - - What , all five out at once ?    37.3241
<BOS> Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .    29.9910
<BOS> We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . " " And that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr . Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! My dear aunt , how could you think of it ?    30.4925
<BOS> Your ' s , & c .    9.1124
<BOS> It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .    23.4309
<BOS> She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence .    26.9760
<BOS> The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .    41.5957
<BOS> It will pass away soon enough . " " Do you suppose them to be in London ? " " Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " " And Lydia used to want to go to London , " added Kitty .    26.4874
<BOS> They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .    31.6338
<BOS> This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .    40.8560
<BOS> Of this she was perfectly unaware ; - - to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .    33.1047
<BOS> I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .    52.9324
<BOS> In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .    35.6077
<BOS> She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ' s inattention .    15.5224
<BOS> " Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it succeeds .    24.9082
<BOS> This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .    52.9957
<BOS> Girls , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ?    27.1486
<BOS> His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others .    38.7301
<BOS> You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . " " That is his notion of christian forgiveness ! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch .    42.5966
<BOS> Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .    17.4743
<BOS> Why was he to be the judge ? " " You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . " " But , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .    29.8338
<BOS> Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ? " " You can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered .    27.1878
<BOS> The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening .    35.8649
<BOS> When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .    30.9644
<BOS> They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other .    27.4142
<BOS> The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr . Darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister .    36.4199
<BOS> The one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago .    50.0372
<BOS> He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .    35.6144
<BOS> Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .    34.3066
<BOS> " Then , " observed Elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . " " Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . " " Oh ! certainly , " cried his faithful assistant , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with .    21.6125
<BOS> " If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " I shall know how to understand it .    23.0317
<BOS> After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .    30.1420
<BOS> But perhaps Mr . Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . " " I should not be surprised , " said Darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . " Elizabeth made no answer .    19.3458
<BOS> When is your turn to come ?    30.7233
<BOS> There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .    50.5862
<BOS> " I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Sir .    22.6658
<BOS> Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Mrs .    22.1569
<BOS> Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .    30.0245
<BOS> My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr . Darcy , to be treating his father ' s favourite in such a manner , - - one , whom his father had promised to provide for . - - It is impossible .    30.2492
<BOS> It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . " Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .    37.2450
<BOS> Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .    21.6099
<BOS> From their infancy , they have been intended for each other .    28.6309
<BOS> A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .    22.3354
<BOS> That is all settled . " " That is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .    24.0559
<BOS> Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .    42.8109
<BOS> To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .    57.9588
<BOS> My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr . Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .    44.5290
<BOS> He cannot afford it .    21.8996
<BOS> Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . " " That is right . - - You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .    29.9242
<BOS> Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .    26.5548
<BOS> Lydia ' s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself .    26.9029
<BOS> I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away .    33.5324
<BOS> Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .    32.7941
<BOS> To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther .    40.7111
<BOS> But it is so strange ! " " Yes - - that is what makes it amusing .    16.8717
<BOS> But I have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest - tempered , most generous - hearted , boy in the world . " Elizabeth almost stared at her . - - " Can this be Mr . Darcy ! " thought she .    32.7454
<BOS> The hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .    52.1674
<BOS> Is not it so , Mrs .    35.9663
<BOS> But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? " " Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " " By all means , " cried Bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more    48.0720
weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of .    19.3432
<BOS> How long has she been such a favourite ? - - and pray when am I to wish you joy ? " " That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask .    35.6408
<BOS> But you have chosen your fault well . - - I really cannot laugh at it .    30.6140
<BOS> But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister ' s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized .    41.7865
<BOS> This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .    59.0249
<BOS> What am I to do ? " " Nothing child , nothing .    32.8326
<BOS> Yours ever , " CAROLINE BINGLEY . " " With the officers ! " cried Lydia .    20.6194
<BOS> " I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter .    29.3496
<BOS> On this subject , what can you have to say ?    25.8129
<BOS> He was received by Mrs .    11.3602
<BOS> Gardiner , with occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .    37.4785
<BOS> Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .    33.8287
<BOS> I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .    50.3274
<BOS> It will save me a world of trouble and economy .    38.4093
<BOS> " What does Mr . Darcy mean , " said she to Charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? " " That is a question which Mr . Darcy only can answer . " " But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about .    19.1393
<BOS> " It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .    14.4753
<BOS> The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .    24.7424
<BOS> Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .    56.7527
<BOS> Well , any friend of Mr . Bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . " Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern .    26.7195
<BOS> Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence .    23.1934
<BOS> But will they make you happy ? " " Have you any other objection , " said Elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? " " None at all .    15.0380
<BOS> Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .    35.9569
<BOS> Had it been your uncle ' s doing , I must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .    56.0315
<BOS> Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .    22.9799
<BOS> My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ; - - most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education .    28.8183
<BOS> As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half - finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Mr . Darcy , and Mr . Darcy only , entered the room .    27.0523
<BOS> " Yes , she called yesterday with her father .    22.2413
<BOS> Let her go then .    80.4135
<BOS> I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .    39.3067
<BOS> At present I am not in love with Mr . Wickham ; no , I certainly am not .    15.4721
<BOS> I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . " " My fingers , " said Elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women ' s do .    31.7162
<BOS> Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . " " If you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone .    20.3814
<BOS> Pemberley was now Georgiana ' s home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see .    34.4650
<BOS> He had never had the slightest suspicion .    28.1037
<BOS> have you heard from my uncle ? " " Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . " " Well , and what news does it bring ?    25.9156
<BOS> I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .    39.5647
<BOS> Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .    55.5253
<BOS> The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield .    38.6886
<BOS> I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .    32.4180
<BOS> By tea - time however the dose had been enough , and Mr . Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing - room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .    32.6767
<BOS> I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . " Darcy mentioned his letter .    20.4669
<BOS> It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .    24.2414
<BOS> As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .    45.0334
<BOS> You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty .    31.3020
<BOS> Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse .    75.3593
<BOS> " What an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut .    19.2057
<BOS> " I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers . - - And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . " " Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " Oh ! yes . - - Do let the portraits of your    26.4603
uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley .    25.7347
<BOS> Forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .    20.0867
<BOS> I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . " " I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .    26.1713
<BOS> For my part , Mr . Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently .    64.0896
<BOS> Mr . Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels . - - Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . - - Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce ' s Sermons .    33.2066
<BOS> Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? " " Yes ; but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it .    30.7470
<BOS> Why must their marriage be private ?    127.7476
<BOS> He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .    42.9207
<BOS> I will put on my things in a moment .    29.7136
<BOS> There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him .    37.5469
<BOS> You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr . Bingley might like you the best of the party . " " My dear , you flatter me .    29.7318
<BOS> When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish .    56.8827
<BOS> Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs .    24.4454
<BOS> It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . " " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth .    13.3224
<BOS> I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . " " His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said Elizabeth angrily ; " for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr . Darcy ' s steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself . " " I beg your pardon , " replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a sneer .    23.0142
<BOS> Besides , there was truth in his looks . " " It is difficult indeed - - it is distressing . - - One does not know what to think . " " I beg your pardon ; - - one knows exactly what to think . " But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , - - that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .    29.2936
<BOS> Bingley and talked of Mrs .    15.7223
<BOS> The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . " " Oh ! do not repeat what I then said .    33.1970
<BOS> But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . " From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr . Darcy had been over - rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs .    38.4119
<BOS> A few weeks , he believed .    27.7173
<BOS> It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .    52.0975
<BOS> Elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr . Darcy and herself .    28.2691
<BOS> We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .    56.6595
<BOS> I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . " " For heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower . - - What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr . Darcy ? - - You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . " Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .    34.8864
<BOS> Stop me whilst you can . " " You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . " " Yes , in conjunction with his friend . " " I cannot believe it .    23.1468
<BOS> If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud . " " That is very true , " replied Elizabeth , " and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . " " Pride , " observed Mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing I believe .    23.4990
<BOS> The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .    38.5443
<BOS> They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .    27.1268
<BOS> There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .    23.0970
<BOS> He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .    48.8124
<BOS> In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . " She held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .    43.6694
<BOS> Gardiner , " I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham .    37.4692
<BOS> Elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley .    43.2408
<BOS> It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .    27.0924
<BOS> But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr . Darcy ? " " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . " " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother - - " because he does not write with ease .    29.9757
<BOS> Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ' s drawing - rooms , and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room .    30.4472
<BOS> " What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ?    14.4601
<BOS> But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion .    35.0717
<BOS> It was at Sir William Lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled .    19.2256
<BOS> You are not going to be Missish , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .    22.4055
<BOS> And his behaviour , so strikingly altered , - - what could it mean ?    32.8975
<BOS> Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .    35.1715
<BOS> Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .    40.4712
<BOS> For , though your accusations were ill - founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .    45.5372
<BOS> Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .    25.3508
<BOS> My father , however , is partial to Mr . Wickham .    9.8398
<BOS> " I have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .    21.0563
<BOS> But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .    35.5203
<BOS> She would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house . " Mr . Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer .    18.7100
<BOS> They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs .    47.4976
<BOS> She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .    30.9918
<BOS> His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham .    36.7853
<BOS> Mr . Bennet protested against any description of finery .    24.0604
<BOS> One ought not to repine ; - - but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! But it was not to be .    23.2414
<BOS> " I must ask whether you were surprised ? " said Elizabeth .    12.9793
<BOS> And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? " " Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .    36.3417
<BOS> Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself . " Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her .    37.8038
<BOS> The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .    25.8439
<BOS> It originated in Mrs .    30.4560
<BOS> I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you .    24.1000
<BOS> If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . " Two days after Mr . Bennet ' s return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , " I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the    29.0770
liberty of coming to ask . " " What do you mean , Hill ?    14.7160
<BOS> " John told us Mr . Darcy was here when you sent for us ; - - was it so ? " " Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .    27.9846
<BOS> Forster , the delight of Mrs .    24.8092
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> I did not wink at you . " She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , " Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , " took her out of the room .    23.1259
<BOS> The horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .    34.7572
<BOS> I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement .    17.6538
<BOS> I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner .    25.0109
<BOS> A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .    35.7028
<BOS> It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long .    16.6878
<BOS> On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .    30.0226
<BOS> Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .    39.5612
<BOS> Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it .    20.3470
<BOS> Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .    18.8537
<BOS> She had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .    29.8741
<BOS> These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .    45.0159
<BOS> " My dear Madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . " They were all astonished ; and Mr . Bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " But is there not danger of Lady Catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ? - - You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . " " My dear sir , " replied Mr . Collins , " I am particularly obliged to you for    23.2949
this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence . " " You cannot be too much on your guard .    28.7564
<BOS> I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . " " I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but I always speak what I think . " " I know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder .    27.1174
<BOS> For though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .    32.0251
<BOS> She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? - - I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . " " If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he    34.6358
chuses , before it begins - - but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . " " I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .    36.9651
<BOS> His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s ear .    27.7572
<BOS> But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .    26.2943
<BOS> The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .    49.8037
<BOS> Assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable .    32.7340
<BOS> The express was sent off directly .    27.4324
<BOS> Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?    44.6853
<BOS> Not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves .    96.0024
<BOS> Do you often dance at St . James ' s ? " " Never , sir . " " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . " " You have a house in town , I conclude ? " Mr . Darcy bowed .    16.6129
<BOS> How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . " He then told her of Georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .    52.3300
<BOS> Mr . Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .    29.0169
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will .    37.5616
<BOS> And then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " To this , Mary very gravely replied , " Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .    49.2175
<BOS> But against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .    30.6197
<BOS> Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . " " I would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried Bingley , " for a kingdom ! Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . " " You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr . Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet .    21.9369
<BOS> Hurst and Miss Bingley .    12.8357
<BOS> Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . - - Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane ' s being in the fairest way for happiness .    32.8501
<BOS> Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self - consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings .    44.0420
<BOS> But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . " Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .    43.9361
<BOS> My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs .    22.6303
<BOS> At last it arrested her - - and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr . Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .    23.5562
<BOS> All this was acknowledged to Mrs .    23.5286
<BOS> " If one could but go to Brighton ! " observed Mrs .    24.4591
<BOS> To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the <NUM> per cents .    27.5954
<BOS> Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the South .    27.7954
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> It was Mr . Collins ' s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .    31.3438
<BOS> As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining - parlour and drawing - room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .    18.9968
<BOS> Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself - - and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " " Nay , " cried Bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .    47.9758
<BOS> When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .    30.9829
<BOS> But my dear Lydia , I don ' t at all like your going such a way off .    25.2126
<BOS> On Saturday he came again .    38.6801
<BOS> Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation .    65.1635
<BOS> I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . " " Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks .    19.7189
<BOS> Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not .    51.3808
<BOS> Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .    38.1920
<BOS> She saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family .    37.3122
<BOS> Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could .    21.8624
<BOS> " If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . " The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair .    26.6263
<BOS> Presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .    34.6217
<BOS> Pray write instantly , and let me understand it - - unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . " " Not that I shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . " Jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; - - till    32.3381
it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .    81.9799
<BOS> Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr . Darcy looked up .    36.4083
<BOS> Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .    25.0887
<BOS> But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money .    39.5865
<BOS> Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .    23.2802
<BOS> It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .    33.7168
<BOS> The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage .    60.0371
<BOS> " I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried Jane .    31.1450
<BOS> He heard her with astonishment .    40.3204
<BOS> Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs .    33.0473
<BOS> Things are settled so oddly . " " You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate . " " Ah ! sir , I do indeed .    26.5364
<BOS> Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . " " Let her be called down .    36.0301
<BOS> But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . - - I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . - - He left Netherfield for London , on    60.8035
the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . - - The part which I acted , is now to be explained . - - His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . - - We accordingly went - - and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . - - I described , and enforced them earnestly . - - But , however this    57.2798
remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference .    35.1729
<BOS> But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham .    49.4116
<BOS> His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill - natured tone that she " wished they might be happy . " Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room .    47.5228
<BOS> My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . " " Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to befall her ? " " I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth .    41.4828
<BOS> They are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines .    46.6249
<BOS> The church ought to have been my profession - - I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . " " Indeed ! " " Yes - - the late Mr . Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift .    37.3797
<BOS> But I will no longer importune my young cousin . " Then turning to Mr . Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .    36.6972
<BOS> Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept .    54.2204
<BOS> The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas ' s last week ; and even Mr . Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least .    41.8071
<BOS> " He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ?    35.8232
<BOS> Believe her to be deceived by all means .    28.9175
<BOS> To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations .    31.5304
<BOS> She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .    45.4928
<BOS> His most particular friend , you see by Jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .    43.1929
<BOS> You know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .    28.3697
<BOS> And what sort of table do they keep ?    80.1561
<BOS> " But I can assure you , " she added , " that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .    24.6423
<BOS> " Yours , & c . " As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind .    33.8361
<BOS> Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .    24.6612
<BOS> They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .    27.8488
<BOS> Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .    44.1307
<BOS> Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master - - and very like him .    30.9662
<BOS> Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . " Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .    29.6699
<BOS> I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .    28.8616
<BOS> The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire - place , that she might be farther from the door .    29.0017
<BOS> The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .    38.8238
<BOS> Yet time and her aunt moved slowly - - and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête - à - tête was over .    43.7749
<BOS> Say that urgent business calls us home immediately .    89.1526
<BOS> It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr . Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her .    13.1977
<BOS> There was no arguing upon such a project .    17.8568
<BOS> But gracious me ! I quite forgot ! I ought not to have said a word about it .    25.5565
<BOS> You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . " " Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied Elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .    22.4064
<BOS> " He is certainly a good brother , " said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .    14.3705
<BOS> " While I can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . - - I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .    25.8751
<BOS> It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .    51.6117
<BOS> Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .    57.6370
<BOS> " Books - - Oh ! no . - - I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . " " I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . - - We may compare our different opinions . " " No - - I cannot talk of books in a ball - room ; my head is always full of something else . " " The present always occupies you in such scenes - - does it ? " said he , with a look of doubt .    24.6251
<BOS> His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .    32.9869
<BOS> She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .    28.0513
<BOS> " You look pale .    31.1209
<BOS> <NUM> .    39.6644
<BOS> With them he is remarkably agreeable . " " I do not believe a word of it , my dear .    15.1455
<BOS> But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . " " And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .    21.5722
<BOS> Annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs .    3.1029
<BOS> As soon as Jane had read Mr . Gardiner ' s hope of Lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .    3.3951
