27.8312
<BOS> Then shewing her purchases : " Look here , I have bought this bonnet .    41.7867
<BOS> " Undoubtedly , " replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .    28.2081
<BOS> Jane's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .    45.0647
<BOS> Mrs . Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the - - - - shire .    22.2724
<BOS> She is grown so brown and coarse !    25.8852
<BOS> Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .    41.2090
<BOS> it is of no consequence .    45.6830
<BOS> " A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh .    20.8915
<BOS> Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?    29.7350
<BOS> Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? "    31.5607
<BOS> To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs . Gardiner's former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated .    40.1936
<BOS> She wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .    37.1719
<BOS> Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .    39.9717
<BOS> But what is that to me ?    32.3991
<BOS> She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night .    33.4483
<BOS> Where shall you change horses ? - - Oh !    29.4615
<BOS> I did not think Mrs . Gardiner was so little to be trusted . "    13.5395
<BOS> " I think she will .    21.3372
<BOS> The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire - place , that she might be farther from the door .    30.4560
<BOS> You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . "    49.9214
<BOS> " But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? "    24.3005
<BOS> The vicious propensities - - the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr . Darcy could not have .    22.8332
<BOS> Things are settled so oddly . "    38.4025
<BOS> Charles , when you build your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . "    30.7996
<BOS> The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Mrs . Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .    40.4993
<BOS> " True .    9.6532
<BOS> She directly replied , " You need not be frightened .    33.8619
<BOS> Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .    46.0034
<BOS> " Impossible , Mr . Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? "    18.4379
<BOS> My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due . "    27.0984
<BOS> " I beg your pardon , " replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a sneer .    10.2116
<BOS> They agreed that Mrs . Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .    31.2366
<BOS> " It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , " said Mr . Bennet , " and nothing can clear Mr . Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn .    19.6835
<BOS> One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , " Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe .    21.7504
<BOS> They had long wished to see him .    21.4457
<BOS> I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . "    25.6147
<BOS> Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .    40.4716
<BOS> I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister .    83.7656
<BOS> Lizzy declares she will not have Mr . Collins , and Mr . Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . "    21.1134
<BOS> I know no harm of her . "    10.7875
<BOS> " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .    24.8669
<BOS> But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs . Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton .    28.0503
<BOS> I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . "    42.5282
<BOS> It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . "    34.1223
<BOS> He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . "    47.4460
<BOS> And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you - - and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . "    28.8580
<BOS> so much the man of fashion !    48.9067
<BOS> You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . "    36.8478
<BOS> It was unpardonable .    15.0585
<BOS> When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .    14.6512
<BOS> But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .    24.2419
<BOS> Mr . Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?    28.2933
<BOS> You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it .    33.3367
<BOS> The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .    36.2500
<BOS> His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections .    32.5473
<BOS> She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to - - she is lost for ever . "    29.8472
<BOS> how unlucky !    49.8967
<BOS> " There were some very strong objections against the lady , " were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London .    56.6260
<BOS> When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .    30.7631
<BOS> The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness !    33.2739
<BOS> He then asked her to walk into the house - - but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .    18.2873
<BOS> Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs . Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate - - but on this point it will be as well to be silent .    35.2435
<BOS> Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility .    31.9659
<BOS> As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ?    52.5577
<BOS> I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs . F . but no one can throw any blame on them .    45.4322
<BOS> He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .    27.6421
<BOS> It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .    27.0948
<BOS> " How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it !    26.5912
<BOS> You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body .    28.7860
<BOS> Hurst . "    26.0513
<BOS> She had obtained private intelligence that Mr . Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr . Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .    30.6518
<BOS> the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! "    71.8448
<BOS> " My dear , dear aunt , " she rapturously cried , " what delight !    23.6109
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? "    12.7333
<BOS> " Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs . Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr . Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . "    28.6077
<BOS> It cannot be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .    29.9474
<BOS> At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular .    58.3027
<BOS> How you must have hated me after that evening ? "    37.9685
<BOS> As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .    30.5059
<BOS> In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived .    26.3021
<BOS> This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for .    34.9243
<BOS> If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud . "    24.1355
<BOS> Mr . Darcy had been at her sister's wedding .    13.4187
<BOS> He was well , but so much engaged with Mr . Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him .    13.7462
<BOS> " FITZWILLIAM DARCY . "    16.3815
<BOS> Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country .    20.6772
<BOS> The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .    49.1475
<BOS> Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself . "    18.7675
<BOS> They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .    24.7871
<BOS> " I advise Mr . Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , " said Mrs . Bennet , " to walk to Oakham Mount this morning .    13.6285
<BOS> My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .    31.7498
<BOS> " MY DEAR NIECE , " I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you .    34.7001
<BOS> I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .    29.5524
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet could hardly contain herself .    11.9485
<BOS> The carriage was sent to meet them at - - - - , and they were to return in it , by dinner - time .    23.1404
<BOS> His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .    49.7877
<BOS> I am going away myself . "    13.0586
<BOS> " And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? "    14.9321
<BOS> how shall I bear so much happiness ! "    69.6301
<BOS> " And men take care that they should . "    46.7269
<BOS> " You judge very properly , " said Mr . Bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .    22.3958
<BOS> It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her .    23.9690
<BOS> Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not . "    16.6851
<BOS> But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .    19.4451
<BOS> Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . - - I know it cannot be long . "    30.2707
<BOS> " With great energy ; - - but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . "    23.4322
<BOS> No , no , you shall not deceive me .    33.6462
<BOS> " Did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? "    23.6405
<BOS> Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . - - But no , " - - recollecting herself , - - " that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : I should not have been allowed to invite them . "    27.2885
<BOS> Lady Catherine seemed resigned .    14.8466
<BOS> The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .    27.1116
<BOS> But I am at his disposal .    15.0552
<BOS> GARDINER . "    7.5923
<BOS> I hate such false friends .    43.1994
<BOS> Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . "    26.2918
<BOS> He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .    58.4655
<BOS> Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself .    26.9458
<BOS> But I suppose you had no opportunity .    18.5897
<BOS> The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen .    36.3936
<BOS> " As much as I ever wish to be , " cried Elizabeth warmly , - - " I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . "    21.2395
<BOS> The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .    34.2931
<BOS> On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting - room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley .    30.2002
<BOS> She tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done .    27.2114
<BOS> " You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . "    10.1259
<BOS> Bingley . - - But - - good lord !    27.6576
<BOS> But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . "    13.3396
<BOS> When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr . Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , Mrs . Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both .    38.1524
<BOS> I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .    39.6285
<BOS> All this was acknowledged to Mrs . Gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : - - " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .    31.6350
<BOS> " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him .    17.4782
<BOS> " Yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !    33.5286
<BOS> Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .    23.1149
<BOS> Mr . Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .    22.7338
<BOS> Those who do not complain are never pitied . "    44.6240
<BOS> The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .    29.8841
<BOS> She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .    38.4433
<BOS> " What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! "    43.9263
<BOS> Mr . Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs . Bennet .    23.5356
<BOS> She has two nieces of her own .    31.6019
<BOS> Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .    19.5570
<BOS> " Not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . "    27.8553
<BOS> You give me fresh life and vigour .    34.5557
<BOS> * * * * * In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .    17.5213
<BOS> Elizabeth was now to see Mr . Wickham for the last time .    12.0448
<BOS> " That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had - - not turned out well .    33.3279
<BOS> " Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried Colonel Fitzwilliam .    20.9353
<BOS> " He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .    25.3398
<BOS> All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .    35.1762
<BOS> I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . "    19.9630
<BOS> Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .    39.5861
<BOS> Your's , very sincerely , " M .    27.0101
<BOS> Is not he a charming man ?    58.5996
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .    51.6768
<BOS> Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .    28.7404
<BOS> Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character .    36.6803
<BOS> My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .    17.0636
<BOS> " My dear , " replied her husband , " I have two small favours to request .    15.3115
<BOS> While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .    66.1041
<BOS> who could have done less for her ?    52.1236
<BOS> As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .    28.3081
<BOS> The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .    23.9818
<BOS> To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .    57.8862
<BOS> This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . "    12.8707
<BOS> " Oh ! "    4.0393
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .    20.6121
<BOS> I am afraid you will be angry . "    10.0699
<BOS> On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .    25.4125
<BOS> " You are quite right .    10.6931
<BOS> If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .    19.8440
<BOS> I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him .    21.5469
<BOS> It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .    30.9159
<BOS> She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .    26.6669
<BOS> do any thing rather than marry without affection .    103.5702
<BOS> " Laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion .    13.9951
<BOS> As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .    33.3326
<BOS> You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone .    51.7203
<BOS> Mr . Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . "    23.9999
<BOS> Mr . Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia .    28.6739
<BOS> Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .    24.2328
<BOS> The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten .    42.6733
<BOS> " I should be sorry indeed , if it were .    17.1134
<BOS> She had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Mr . Darcy , she moved again towards the gate .    27.2465
<BOS> How odious I should think them ! "    29.3127
<BOS> I must have employment and society .    37.3019
<BOS> On finding Mrs . Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? "    27.6971
<BOS> " By all means , " cried Bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of .    34.4211
<BOS> Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .    35.4817
<BOS> Charlotte the wife of Mr . Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! - - And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .    34.0235
<BOS> I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh .    58.2758
<BOS> His appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .    29.3277
<BOS> You have liked many a stupider person . "    29.5741
<BOS> His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the - - - - shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .    17.1533
<BOS> " Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .    25.4739
<BOS> The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week ; and even Mr . Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least .    29.2703
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war - office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton .    43.3045
<BOS> But I will no longer importune my young cousin . "    27.6138
<BOS> " No , she would go home .    13.9792
<BOS> The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .    24.9682
<BOS> The rest of the evening brought her little amusement .    23.9625
<BOS> There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! "    21.3054
<BOS> Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .    15.8807
<BOS> would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .    50.9549
<BOS> Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to you .    25.4923
<BOS> After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .    60.6846
<BOS> When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .    34.8881
<BOS> Mary , " said she , " I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !    16.0668
<BOS> She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .    32.4786
<BOS> what does he say ?    39.3416
<BOS> On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .    29.5453
<BOS> Your uncle is as much surprised as I am - - and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .    24.1963
<BOS> " Hate you !    17.3346
<BOS> But I hope you will not mind it : it is all for Jane's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .    23.7920
<BOS> At length , she spoke again .    14.0853
<BOS> But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ?    23.7019
<BOS> And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .    57.3854
<BOS> The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way - - teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .    41.9966
<BOS> Lady Catherine was generally speaking - - stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .    33.3328
<BOS> The supposition did not pain her .    48.2489
<BOS> At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable .    21.4133
<BOS> She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family .    39.6113
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth : " My dearest Lizzy , " I FIND myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday .    37.4116
<BOS> And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead .    40.7368
<BOS> - - said Jane faintly smiling , - - " You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . "    27.3335
<BOS> I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . "    26.5010
<BOS> " I know them a little .    19.6413
<BOS> He was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .    21.1981
<BOS> my sweetest Lizzy !    50.5669
<BOS> I do not know who is good enough for him . "    13.0624
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Mr . Collins began .    14.2480
<BOS> But I must write no more .    14.3304
<BOS> " Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? "    31.1320
<BOS> Now is your time .    43.9388
<BOS> To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh ?    28.1476
<BOS> A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise - - and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .    26.3125
<BOS> From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr . Darcy had been over - rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs . Gardiner's long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : " I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write .    36.7875
<BOS> " You may depend on it , " replied the other , " for Mrs . Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true .    22.1267
<BOS> I will have no reserves from you . "    9.7614
<BOS> They solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .    37.2067
<BOS> Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . "    36.7359
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> Mrs . Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . "    38.7023
<BOS> " What think you of books ? "    12.7249
<BOS> It is not quite a week since they left Brighton .    17.5332
<BOS> " He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle .    14.0268
<BOS> In this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .    30.8031
<BOS> " Have you any other objection , " said Elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? "    15.1912
<BOS> Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .    23.6179
<BOS> I was uncomfortable enough .    41.2792
<BOS> This is the estimation in which you hold me !    35.2276
<BOS> Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .    47.8331
<BOS> We have heard nothing from town . "    14.9749
<BOS> But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could . "    29.9914
<BOS> " His pride , " said Miss Lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .    20.4558
<BOS> In ran Mrs . Bennet to her daughter's room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down .    35.1066
<BOS> She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs . Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .    29.5270
<BOS> Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .    60.7367
<BOS> " And what did she say ? "    13.9698
<BOS> She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .    19.3156
<BOS> Such was Miss Lucas's scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon .    49.5425
<BOS> You are lucky in having such a master . "    24.4786
<BOS> After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .    20.5628
<BOS> " And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? "    41.0952
<BOS> She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .    27.8035
<BOS> So far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .    50.2311
<BOS> Elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .    43.8828
<BOS> They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .    28.9952
<BOS> I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , - - but of this hereafter .    36.0463
<BOS> Anxiety on Jane's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr . Darcy's explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost .    40.1955
<BOS> She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr . Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows . "    33.4994
<BOS> To this , Mary very gravely replied , " Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .    44.6563
<BOS> Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self - consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings .    40.9146
<BOS> They will ruin your happiness .    29.8030
<BOS> " To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone !    31.4037
<BOS> Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining - parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr . Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement .    34.6710
<BOS> Mr . Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him .    24.4357
<BOS> The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr . Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs .    21.9117
<BOS> The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence . - - " He is now gone into the army , " she added , " but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . "    22.0294
<BOS> cried Elizabeth , when she had finished .    12.5939
<BOS> " I do not at all know ; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield .    19.3129
<BOS> " Such as vanity and pride . "    32.4903
<BOS> Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence .    34.9866
<BOS> They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . "    34.6363
<BOS> She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .    57.8702
<BOS> Her aunt now called her to look at a picture .    33.6542
<BOS> Miss Bingley I am sure cannot .    53.3155
<BOS> said Elizabeth to herself . - - " You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .    27.8104
<BOS> At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner .    35.8339
<BOS> that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .    50.1861
<BOS> " At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . "    27.8035
<BOS> One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . "    26.0027
<BOS> No one but Mrs . Bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .    32.5023
<BOS> When they were all in the drawing - room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give .    24.4112
<BOS> I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely .    37.3078
<BOS> Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . "    33.8993
<BOS> What pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !    49.1553
<BOS> Never , since reading Jane's second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her .    51.3405
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , " Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .    22.4224
<BOS> " It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . "    34.2135
<BOS> She was engaged one day as she walked , in re - perusing Jane's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .    38.6355
<BOS> Her fellow - travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .    38.3879
<BOS> If he no longer cares for me , why silent ?    56.3859
<BOS> His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham .    33.3552
<BOS> Mr . Darcy's letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .    36.6908
<BOS> By nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at St . James's had made him courteous .    28.4616
<BOS> That tall , proud man . "    59.3421
<BOS> " I might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?    37.6552
<BOS> She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .    26.8403
<BOS> ' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . '    28.0940
<BOS> Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .    24.3609
<BOS> It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . "    16.7927
<BOS> This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty - seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .    25.9929
<BOS> Her astonishment at his coming - - at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire .    30.5985
<BOS> Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great .    17.7454
<BOS> The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better .    32.1044
<BOS> He could not speak a word for full ten minutes .    27.8809
<BOS> No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .    48.0437
<BOS> In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet .    26.2294
<BOS> Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr . Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . - - Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .    42.4753
<BOS> All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road .    40.7289
<BOS> but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .    49.9056
<BOS> " And this , " cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me !    17.8854
<BOS> And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road . "    30.8424
<BOS> Though Mr . Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .    18.7238
<BOS> I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother .    25.1432
<BOS> This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .    30.0509
<BOS> Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self - destined to another .    52.5011
<BOS> " Good gracious !    8.9593
<BOS> A most delightful place ! - - Excellent Parsonage House !    60.7427
<BOS> " Indeed I am .    12.8032
<BOS> I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . "    27.9340
<BOS> " Yes , Sir , I know I am .    11.9982
<BOS> It was in the Times and the Courier , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be .    25.9436
<BOS> My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you can't think .    54.9979
<BOS> She began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .    38.0577
<BOS> " Do you suppose them to be in London ? "    11.0344
<BOS> Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! "    26.7755
<BOS> " No , " said Colonel Fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me .    13.1939
<BOS> In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .    36.8787
<BOS> " To - morrow fortnight . "    19.7068
<BOS> But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable .    21.3585
<BOS> She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .    27.7887
<BOS> Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .    27.0729
<BOS> Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .    27.8515
<BOS> He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done .    35.8347
<BOS> The least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person .    72.6027
<BOS> After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard .    40.5008
<BOS> There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .    23.7888
<BOS> Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .    36.1070
<BOS> At length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready .    25.4554
<BOS> " I will not trust myself on the subject , " replied Wickham , " I can hardly be just to him . "    11.1134
<BOS> Now , Lizzy , I think I have surprised you .    24.5572
<BOS> Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly . "    25.6347
<BOS> Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .    37.3079
<BOS> He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .    39.4536
<BOS> Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . "    31.6794
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner .    26.0184
<BOS> I appeal to Mr . Darcy : - - but let me not interrupt you , Sir . - - You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . "    24.8477
<BOS> Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .    62.9755
<BOS> she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld !    32.1177
<BOS> She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .    15.4934
<BOS> All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .    79.6753
<BOS> Every thing being settled between them , Mr . Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch - street the evening before I came home .    33.7699
<BOS> I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .    42.5967
<BOS> His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield .    34.8943
<BOS> They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .    48.7785
<BOS> For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him .    28.8658
<BOS> " At four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman , " said Mr . Bennet , as he folded up the letter .    21.9979
<BOS> She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial .    19.3234
<BOS> Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it .    38.3908
<BOS> He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .    35.1918
<BOS> Their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp .    50.3125
<BOS> He knows where we live .    68.8343
<BOS> They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .    31.6518
<BOS> sir , I do indeed .    34.1427
<BOS> Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings .    23.8797
<BOS> " Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , " said Elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . "    21.2978
<BOS> She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .    30.3397
<BOS> added Elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . "    45.1914
<BOS> " That you certainly shall . "    21.4641
<BOS> He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .    29.1450
<BOS> We must not make him desperate . "    16.9530
<BOS> If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen .    18.1048
<BOS> " You have only proved by this , " cried Elizabeth , " that Mr . Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .    13.9442
<BOS> " Mr . Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . "    27.4532
<BOS> " They are going to be encamped near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer !    39.4071
<BOS> " And so was I . "    36.5330
<BOS> Mr . Darcy is engaged to my daughter .    12.0219
<BOS> " But you see that Jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . "    14.1761
<BOS> Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield .    30.9153
<BOS> " Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs . Bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way . - - But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all - - and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead . - - I shall not be able to keep you - - and so I warn you . - - I have done with you from this very day . - - I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .    24.2365
<BOS> The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .    46.2543
<BOS> " My fingers , " said Elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do .    22.2892
<BOS> I have certainly meant well through the whole affair .    39.1944
<BOS> so tall ! - - Oh , my dear Lizzy !    12.5286
<BOS> You know him too well to doubt the rest .    35.6793
<BOS> " I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news .    23.5927
<BOS> In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . "    30.4257
<BOS> Poor dear child !    43.8978
<BOS> You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say .    24.1026
<BOS> cried Elizabeth when she had finished it .    22.3324
<BOS> It was a large , well - proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .    24.6094
<BOS> From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce .    30.3380
<BOS> Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment's deliberation , " I am not . "    29.0483
<BOS> Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .    50.7009
<BOS> Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .    39.0999
<BOS> here comes Hill .    89.8508
<BOS> You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . "    42.6124
<BOS> Nor was Darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .    30.7175
<BOS> Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .    51.0349
<BOS> How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !    80.8347
<BOS> " I am afraid , Mr . Darcy , " observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . "    17.6929
<BOS> Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .    17.8688
<BOS> Their fortune on both sides is splendid .    63.1689
<BOS> Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .    32.5412
<BOS> " Is that his design in settling here ? "    32.7069
<BOS> In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .    45.9676
<BOS> " Don't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven's sake !    51.6288
<BOS> You must learn some of my philosophy .    27.2745
<BOS> After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .    23.0708
<BOS> She shall hear my opinion . "    17.2959
<BOS> " They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . "    18.0063
<BOS> Jane was by no means better .    15.6124
<BOS> The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense .    47.5044
<BOS> I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly .    37.9805
<BOS> Mr . Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .    28.8346
<BOS> They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .    20.3253
<BOS> " Let her be called down .    55.1854
<BOS> And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr . Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .    31.1674
<BOS> which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .    35.8740
<BOS> You had much better dance . "    26.8531
<BOS> " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth .    9.4233
<BOS> Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .    31.1982
<BOS> A clergyman like you must marry . - - Chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way .    49.4058
<BOS> It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .    27.8691
<BOS> Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled !    39.3077
<BOS> Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . "    30.9337
<BOS> Wont it , Kitty ? "    52.5003
<BOS> She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .    43.2660
<BOS> " Oh , lord !    8.7565
<BOS> * * * * * They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ; and Mrs . Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour's visit , had revived .    24.3893
<BOS> Yet time and her aunt moved slowly - - and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te - - t te was over .    29.3221
<BOS> These are conditions , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you .    23.7794
<BOS> You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared !    35.1401
<BOS> " I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr . Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .    26.9735
<BOS> " Ten thousand pounds !    16.8310
<BOS> Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out . - - She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success .    34.6019
<BOS> He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane's letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .    38.8090
<BOS> She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .    27.7127
<BOS> Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . "    25.6351
<BOS> She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .    26.8687
<BOS> Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !    36.4059
<BOS> " What is there of good to be expected ? "    24.0530
<BOS> Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting - woman was in it .    33.9098
<BOS> The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each .    39.5844
<BOS> " True , " said Mr . Bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . "    21.2549
<BOS> " I am sure , " said she , " I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away .    19.3465
<BOS> My father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr . Philips , appears to do so much credit to - - but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr . Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property .    23.6715
<BOS> " You must not blame my aunt .    12.7269
<BOS> " What would she have said ? - - how would she have behaved ? "    26.7320
<BOS> Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight .    34.1080
<BOS> " That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me . "    29.9414
<BOS> Mr . Bennet protested against any description of finery .    24.2124
<BOS> I was ready to die of laughter .    23.6258
<BOS> She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .    31.1202
<BOS> Yet he knew to the contrary himself .    53.8471
<BOS> Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully .    32.6743
<BOS> I am perfectly serious in my refusal . - - You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so . - - Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . "    23.0919
<BOS> I send no compliments to your mother .    27.2587
<BOS> He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr . Darcy , with an expression of half - laughing alarm .    33.3064
<BOS> There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . "    44.9800
<BOS> The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough .    33.8161
<BOS> You have no compassion on my poor nerves . "    18.4049
<BOS> They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .    29.7203
<BOS> Philips . - - The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .    37.0227
<BOS> As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " This is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of .    41.1105
<BOS> " Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , " said Mr . Collins very gravely - - " but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .    21.2972
<BOS> we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's .    50.1472
<BOS> " He brought it with him for us to see . "    30.6809
<BOS> The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .    43.8352
<BOS> " Could I expect it to be otherwise ! "    16.3588
<BOS> She saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers .    52.7067
<BOS> cried his wife impatiently .    21.9369
<BOS> You tear them to pieces . "    22.3288
<BOS> He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . "    19.5001
<BOS> Mr . Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .    31.2866
<BOS> If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .    20.9700
<BOS> As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .    32.5246
<BOS> They are wanted in the farm , Mr . Bennet , are not they ? "    19.8416
<BOS> what could she mean by it ?    51.9421
<BOS> Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .    28.7359
<BOS> In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !    84.7731
<BOS> " It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .    31.0554
<BOS> " I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .    20.0900
<BOS> " I am not now to learn , " replied Mr . Collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .    38.1284
<BOS> " I did not think Caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London .    21.8632
<BOS> Miss Darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .    28.7211
<BOS> " Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said Darcy , " has too much truth .    20.3870
<BOS> But her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came .    42.9461
<BOS> Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever .    26.9386
<BOS> I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference .    30.4460
<BOS> But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying - - and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . "    29.1753
<BOS> My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it .    31.7820
<BOS> There was no want of discourse .    21.6765
<BOS> She attracted him more than he liked - - and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself .    23.9564
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world .    29.3272
<BOS> The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .    41.3806
<BOS> She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .    20.1752
<BOS> Bingley . "    12.5648
<BOS> Why Jane - - you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing !    67.2853
<BOS> It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .    34.3481
<BOS> Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone .    34.6626
<BOS> " You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . - - Are you much acquainted with Mr .    34.9532
<BOS> We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . "    18.9496
<BOS> no , no , this is not likely .    142.1436
<BOS> We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve .    28.0961
<BOS> Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .    26.4988
<BOS> I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr . Bingley .    18.1201
<BOS> " Yours , & c . " As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind .    38.6490
<BOS> Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ?    52.5141
<BOS> " John told us Mr . Darcy was here when you sent for us ; - - was it so ? "    34.0994
<BOS> The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . "    31.0441
<BOS> " A thorough , determined dislike of me - - a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .    46.2071
<BOS> cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her .    30.3937
<BOS> " What is Mr . Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ?    13.3381
<BOS> cried Mrs . Gardiner .    9.6247
<BOS> Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs . Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield .    35.1320
<BOS> " Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister .    18.3679
<BOS> " We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .    16.1564
<BOS> He is so excessively handsome !    22.7583
<BOS> But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized .    42.2968
<BOS> Kitty , run down and order the carriage .    39.4457
<BOS> But I confess they would have no charms for me .    19.7037
<BOS> With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .    34.8805
<BOS> I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well - informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .    34.9548
<BOS> The moment of her release from him was ecstacy .    28.6314
<BOS> " And may I ask ? "    15.5209
<BOS> I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .    28.8771
<BOS> " Good Heaven !    12.3493
<BOS> I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins's character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . "    29.5191
<BOS> Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .    34.7093
<BOS> Darcy said nothing at all .    32.6336
<BOS> They were to be off as soon as possible .    11.7003
<BOS> You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .    45.9183
<BOS> How strange must it appear to him !    46.7363
<BOS> Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step .    33.2760
<BOS> It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; Oxford , Blenheim , Warwick , Kenelworth , Birmingham , & c . are sufficiently known .    30.6251
<BOS> had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do !    66.8062
<BOS> " It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began .    29.3265
<BOS> After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to Elizabeth , " I hope you are well , Miss Bennet .    20.6361
<BOS> " I am all astonishment .    15.9468
<BOS> It must be an amusing study . "    22.1376
<BOS> " And what is your success ? "    10.0340
<BOS> It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .    27.9657
<BOS> The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother's in sending it .    49.8096
<BOS> When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .    25.1898
<BOS> " Does that young lady know Mr .    35.9683
<BOS> The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention .    34.5241
<BOS> With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and February pass away .    53.7982
<BOS> " Perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister .    14.8399
<BOS> " I am sure there is not on his .    12.2457
<BOS> " He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only . "    31.0541
<BOS> After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .    22.7880
<BOS> I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .    47.3094
<BOS> Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . "    13.3046
<BOS> Mr . Darcy danced only once with Mrs . Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .    27.7162
<BOS> " With three younger sisters grown up , " replied Elizabeth smiling , " your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . "    32.4802
<BOS> But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .    28.5527
<BOS> He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character .    28.6499
<BOS> Have you seen any pleasant men ?    85.3235
<BOS> The girls stared at their father .    22.4644
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> Indeed , Mr . Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire - - and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too - - for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . "    33.1876
<BOS> I do not wish to avoid the walk .    17.1614
<BOS> " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! "    25.1566
<BOS> Jane's is nothing to it - - nothing at all .    73.6997
<BOS> Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned .    30.0134
<BOS> dear me !    44.2062
<BOS> how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner .    47.5304
<BOS> " She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind .    29.6441
<BOS> " Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say .    9.9489
<BOS> He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father .    31.9131
<BOS> Elizabeth looked surprised .    20.7080
<BOS> It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter - day , almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .    30.2979
<BOS> Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ?    48.5644
<BOS> Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card - table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game .    25.3438
<BOS> But I know the foundation is unjust .    28.0378
<BOS> His disposition must be dreadful . "    15.0101
<BOS> Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .    23.8705
<BOS> " You may well warn me against such an evil .    20.5850
<BOS> Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .    36.3385
<BOS> Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .    47.5617
<BOS> But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . Gardiner's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .    32.7394
<BOS> " Ah !    7.2183
<BOS> " But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? "    29.7532
<BOS> " How abominable ! - - I wonder that the very pride of this Mr . Darcy has not made him just to you ! - - If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , - - for dishonesty I must call it . "    26.3119
<BOS> " I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other .    26.1311
<BOS> But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .    52.8672
<BOS> His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire .    28.4902
<BOS> Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .    38.6274
<BOS> I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . "    22.6999
<BOS> I don't know .    39.0725
<BOS> They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families .    25.4310
<BOS> " No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . "    20.4550
<BOS> Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented .    32.8114
<BOS> He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .    50.9084
<BOS> You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .    40.6113
<BOS> Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .    26.9247
<BOS> She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .    30.8239
<BOS> " I should not be surprised , " said Darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . "    13.3472
<BOS> Very odd ! - - And you only the second . - - The younger ones out before the elder are married ! - - Your younger sisters must be very young ? "    24.2462
<BOS> As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining - parlour and drawing - room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .    15.8803
<BOS> I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .    22.1613
<BOS> " Let us sit down .    19.7247
<BOS> Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .    25.0561
<BOS> Mr . Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr . Bingley .    17.1582
<BOS> Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . "    18.5302
<BOS> was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .    70.9918
<BOS> There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr . Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord - - - - and to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr . Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him .    23.0390
<BOS> " Whatever I do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes .    30.7984
<BOS> It became her turn to listen .    45.5489
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !    33.6009
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of .    19.2981
<BOS> It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .    31.0435
<BOS> Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .    43.9799
<BOS> And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty - - which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless .    41.3534
<BOS> I wonder what he can be doing there . "    23.5689
<BOS> " Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ?    18.6250
<BOS> Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . - - Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness .    37.9082
<BOS> She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and good - naturedly engaged Mr . Collins's conversation to herself .    32.2771
<BOS> Our poor mother is sadly grieved .    42.2340
<BOS> A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year .    22.3194
<BOS> I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford .    23.5249
<BOS> He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .    30.7597
<BOS> Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?    27.1570
<BOS> " You may depend upon it , Madam , " said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , " that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . "    20.0441
<BOS> " Do you really think so ? "    13.2551
<BOS> Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Mr . Wickham and herself .    17.5912
<BOS> " I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . "    20.5793
<BOS> You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address .    47.9025
<BOS> The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again .    28.1039
<BOS> to put me on my guard ?    67.7348
<BOS> Little more than half a day's journey .    36.9157
<BOS> Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , ( glancing at her sister and Bingley , ) shall take place .    38.8038
<BOS> I am glad he is gone .    17.4751
<BOS> Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .    34.4629
<BOS> Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .    39.8180
<BOS> Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .    20.6207
<BOS> I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !    29.9049
<BOS> " I am sick of Mr . Bingley , " cried his wife .    7.2835
<BOS> But do not be cast down .    27.8124
<BOS> Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?    55.9177
<BOS> Mr . Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement .    28.0440
<BOS> They now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought .    66.8368
<BOS> They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family .    40.9137
<BOS> and her calling here was prodigiously civil !    139.7941
<BOS> I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . "    28.0914
<BOS> Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .    36.6882
<BOS> You do not look well .    14.2954
<BOS> It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr . Darcy !    34.8354
<BOS> Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .    46.0641
<BOS> " I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man . "    24.5019
<BOS> Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .    41.5396
<BOS> " You are severe on us . "    10.8556
<BOS> Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .    31.5178
<BOS> no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .    127.5985
<BOS> Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . "    37.3950
<BOS> " Oh ! "    4.0393
<BOS> How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?    57.3480
<BOS> It was very little less .    16.1220
<BOS> There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . "    44.8785
<BOS> Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .    95.5183
<BOS> You are safe from me . "    17.2534
<BOS> Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .    32.7887
<BOS> The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .    30.2566
<BOS> At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .    31.5862
<BOS> And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .    26.1909
<BOS> She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr . Darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .    25.1740
<BOS> She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . - - Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .    38.1960
<BOS> and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !    148.4759
<BOS> Besides , there was truth in his looks . "    45.7464
<BOS> " You write uncommonly fast . "    25.4920
<BOS> Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane's beauty .    67.5301
<BOS> At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .    37.1318
<BOS> To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little Theatre was open .    73.3119
<BOS> what felicity !    112.0964
<BOS> Mrs . Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me ?    45.2344
<BOS> " I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .    25.8638
<BOS> " If one could but go to Brighton ! "    41.0301
<BOS> cried Lydia .    14.2142
<BOS> She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished .    28.4599
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror .    31.8605
<BOS> Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James's .    35.0121
<BOS> " But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about .    29.4770
<BOS> Mr . Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .    20.4312
<BOS> All loveliness and goodness as she is !    46.0533
<BOS> His attachment to Rosings , certainly increases . "    32.3264
<BOS> Lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .    45.8434
<BOS> Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . "    27.3742
<BOS> Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs .    21.8766
<BOS> Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . - - Mr .    30.0852
<BOS> " Never , sir . "    18.2967
<BOS> Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .    37.8523
<BOS> Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . "    17.7606
<BOS> She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .    29.5493
<BOS> My feelings in every respect forbid it .    31.1262
<BOS> " And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added Kitty .    26.7175
<BOS> This was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage .    28.9718
<BOS> My sisters may write to me .    25.3256
<BOS> " But surely , " said she , " I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . "    18.9889
<BOS> They soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .    13.7489
<BOS> " I can much more easily believe Mr . Bingley's being imposed on , than that Mr . Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony . - - If it be not so , let Mr . Darcy contradict it .    33.7976
<BOS> for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well .    36.9205
<BOS> They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .    37.2700
<BOS> He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided .    28.4421
<BOS> She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will make her know it . "    18.0846
<BOS> This information , however , startled Mrs . Bennet ; - - she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so .    25.8193
<BOS> Shall you like to have such a brother ? "    22.9191
<BOS> He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy .    34.4707
<BOS> " Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings .    28.1763
<BOS> " We are not in a way to know what Mr . Bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . "    14.0359
<BOS> " In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . "    33.1850
<BOS> When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when Mrs . Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing - rooms , and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room .    36.0610
<BOS> But , perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .    29.6578
<BOS> They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .    53.5707
<BOS> With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs . Bingley and talked of Mrs . Darcy may be guessed .    42.6889
<BOS> " How strange this is !    30.4306
<BOS> As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables .    29.9667
<BOS> " I suspected as much , " replied Elizabeth .    13.3712
<BOS> The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .    31.2591
<BOS> Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .    23.5473
<BOS> He took the hint , and soon began with , " This seems a very comfortable house .    37.2767
<BOS> So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart .    58.5373
<BOS> They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade .    26.1066
<BOS> " Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance .    11.4227
<BOS> Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard - heartedness in any of the family .    40.8105
<BOS> This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .    38.5696
<BOS> But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded .    30.3661
<BOS> " He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . "    25.6417
<BOS> That he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating . "    17.5895
<BOS> What will become of me .    30.2305
<BOS> I have not that pain .    39.4397
<BOS> In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .    33.4764
<BOS> I ought not to have said a word about it .    16.6232
<BOS> Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .    25.8376
<BOS> Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him .    20.7209
<BOS> I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .    21.4520
<BOS> There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town .    32.0594
<BOS> After a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display .    54.4709
<BOS> Mr . Jones says we must not think of moving her .    41.1625
<BOS> On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .    24.2575
<BOS> " You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !    19.6429
<BOS> It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr . Collins joining in , observed , " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her .    25.6397
<BOS> How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine .    31.5671
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet was quite in the fidgets .    8.1820
<BOS> To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley .    36.3143
<BOS> " Speak to Lizzy about it yourself .    64.9406
<BOS> Mr . Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .    21.4449
<BOS> " How strange ! "    7.1648
<BOS> " They have both , " said she , " been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .    22.1440
<BOS> In Lydia's imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .    35.9354
<BOS> She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .    34.9182
<BOS> " Yes ; but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it .    31.9838
<BOS> The others have been gone on to Scarborough , these three weeks . "    27.1817
<BOS> said he hastily , as he opened the door .    16.6035
<BOS> But you are always giving her the preference . "    35.1833
<BOS> Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr . Darcy's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .    28.3389
<BOS> She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .    52.0898
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over . - - To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed .    31.4488
<BOS> It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . "    47.3759
<BOS> You must and shall be married by a special licence .    37.6634
<BOS> I hope she will turn out well . "    26.8722
<BOS> We will go round the Park every day .    30.3715
<BOS> Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .    35.7643
<BOS> though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . "    29.4116
<BOS> - - and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .    23.7691
<BOS> He seldom appeared really animated .    59.6053
<BOS> A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and Mrs . Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .    33.5919
<BOS> She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour .    32.3352
<BOS> " Indeed , Mr . Bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! "    16.7877
<BOS> With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .    53.1742
<BOS> thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! "    73.2675
<BOS> Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Mr . Gardiner's house , where they were to remain a few days .    26.1175
<BOS> She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley .    17.1435
<BOS> My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .    31.9938
<BOS> Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .    17.1920
<BOS> The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .    45.6052
<BOS> " This is wholly unexpected .    16.0973
<BOS> They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .    29.1928
<BOS> Have you never happened to see her there ? "    20.2810
<BOS> Every body is disgusted with his pride .    18.8410
<BOS> " If he wants our society , let him seek it .    33.0402
<BOS> Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . "    28.6317
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> In a few days Mr . Bingley returned Mr . Bennet's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .    18.3996
<BOS> The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .    41.8116
<BOS> It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !    45.4277
<BOS> Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy .    29.9344
<BOS> The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .    37.9695
<BOS> The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .    51.3699
<BOS> " It is more than I engage for , I assure you . "    15.2246
<BOS> " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .    24.5408
<BOS> " Did not you ?    23.4496
<BOS> Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr . Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .    24.3218
<BOS> This was agreed to , and Mrs . Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .    24.1088
<BOS> Perhaps he thought her too young .    48.9400
<BOS> Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr . Darcy returned within the stated time .    44.5644
<BOS> " You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .    17.0383
<BOS> Mr . Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began .    32.8086
<BOS> As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper .    39.1801
<BOS> " It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .    14.9489
<BOS> Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .    34.1255
<BOS> I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children . - - Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body .    25.8962
<BOS> " Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? "    24.7069
<BOS> " La !    10.4410
<BOS> Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .    41.6303
<BOS> There is nothing else to be done .    9.1994
<BOS> Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ?    80.2006
<BOS> On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .    23.2574
<BOS> But , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . "    25.8551
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .    53.6620
<BOS> " Indeed I do not dare . "    13.2466
<BOS> The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . "    27.0342
<BOS> There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . "    38.8184
<BOS> Mrs . Wickham !    16.9087
<BOS> " I had much rather go in the coach . "    26.8040
<BOS> I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . "    45.2257
<BOS> She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him .    31.9476
<BOS> You are a gentleman's daughter .    25.5011
<BOS> He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .    37.9634
<BOS> She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door .    30.5575
<BOS> She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .    34.5177
<BOS> She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .    51.3190
<BOS> Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .    21.6176
<BOS> I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away .    24.7269
<BOS> But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .    48.5406
<BOS> pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .    26.8949
<BOS> " Miss Bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be .    14.3949
<BOS> " Excuse my interference . - - It was kindly meant . "    25.9852
<BOS> A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .    46.0459
<BOS> " My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? "    11.7727
<BOS> From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help .    40.7751
<BOS> I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . "    22.4335
<BOS> Did she call to refuse her consent ? "    67.0763
<BOS> Nobody can tell what I suffer ! - - But it is always so .    26.3292
<BOS> It is really too distressing .    25.9675
<BOS> She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Mr . Hurst had a house .    35.2193
<BOS> And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . "    56.3778
<BOS> She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? - - I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . "    40.0279
<BOS> She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr . Darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .    28.1202
<BOS> He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley .    18.1501
<BOS> Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said , " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month .    24.0919
<BOS> was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .    21.4719
<BOS> Elizabeth made no objection ; - - the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .    18.6057
<BOS> There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .    40.1877
<BOS> " Very true , indeed ; - - and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? - - Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . "    33.8578
<BOS> We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode .    31.6177
<BOS> Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?    74.2286
<BOS> If it was not for the entail I should not mind it . "    22.8072
<BOS> His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .    15.8192
<BOS> We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr . Wickham with money . "    20.8978
<BOS> As for your Elizabeth's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? "    56.1051
<BOS> Jane looked at her doubtingly .    10.8780
<BOS> Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " - - and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .    24.2958
<BOS> On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr . Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .    39.7858
<BOS> The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her .    35.9318
<BOS> My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking .    69.6221
<BOS> Her colour changed , and she said no more .    20.7284
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> Elizabeth silently attended her .    39.0864
<BOS> Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . "    34.5714
<BOS> When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr . Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .    27.0630
<BOS> Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .    15.2359
<BOS> At present I am not in love with Mr . Wickham ; no , I certainly am not .    19.8841
<BOS> but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " Is it in address that he improves ?    30.9810
<BOS> My reasons for believing it are briefly these : - - It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .    48.2719
<BOS> You deserve no such attention .    29.7920
<BOS> You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . "    28.9256
<BOS> said Elizabeth .    9.5990
<BOS> I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her .    56.8025
<BOS> He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .    50.7401
<BOS> Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it .    29.0743
<BOS> " My dearest sister , now be be serious .    24.2256
<BOS> Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing - room .    23.4023
<BOS> On this subject , what can you have to say ?    17.7758
<BOS> To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .    78.0515
<BOS> She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter .    21.4475
<BOS> Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .    36.9221
<BOS> " Yes .    7.4110
<BOS> Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .    23.8408
<BOS> " My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? "    22.6227
<BOS> There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .    28.6700
<BOS> " As often as I can .    36.2777
<BOS> We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way .    36.1712
<BOS> Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention .    56.5272
<BOS> As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen .    48.2846
<BOS> " A gamester ! "    12.2265
<BOS> Elizabeth made no answer .    4.8721
<BOS> " I never thought Mr . Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . "    18.2913
<BOS> When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs . Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr . Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .    30.8354
<BOS> At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction .    49.0356
<BOS> It seemed like wilful ill - nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .    43.2265
<BOS> do not repeat what I then said .    31.5840
<BOS> He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .    15.9916
<BOS> Mr . Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them .    20.6936
<BOS> She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . "    34.2579
<BOS> " We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .    22.7324
<BOS> My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . "    10.7589
<BOS> Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .    35.4278
<BOS> If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents .    40.7784
<BOS> Is it true ? "    47.5949
<BOS> Lydia's being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites .    35.0440
<BOS> Oh , brother , how kind you are !    55.6785
<BOS> Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .    33.7607
<BOS> Mr . Darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me .    21.0844
<BOS> Mr . Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .    38.3570
<BOS> I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . "    15.3059
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . - - But their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle .    34.3759
<BOS> The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .    59.8411
<BOS> The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .    26.4578
<BOS> No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .    121.8124
<BOS> Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat - - a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return .    20.0435
<BOS> " It keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . "    16.1951
<BOS> " I do not believe a word of it , my dear .    7.4056
<BOS> It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . "    24.0795
<BOS> The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr . Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr . Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter .    19.4685
<BOS> I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .    24.1798
<BOS> But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !    32.0733
<BOS> were questions with which she amused herself .    58.4076
<BOS> " Heaven forbid ! - - That would be the greatest misfortune of all ! - - To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! - - Do not wish me such an evil . "    31.5008
<BOS> " You doubt me , " cried Jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason .    20.7070
<BOS> But here he was set right by Mrs . Bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .    25.3459
<BOS> " Let me write for you , " said Jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . "    11.4428
<BOS> " What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? "    16.7879
<BOS> " But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr . Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . "    15.8687
<BOS> After walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .    21.5648
<BOS> Had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr . Darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it .    47.5424
<BOS> " Upon my word , Sir , " cried Elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .    35.3247
<BOS> Their situation was awkward enough ; but her's she thought was still worse .    48.0195
<BOS> what is the matter ? "    15.0011
<BOS> A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .    53.2075
<BOS> I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character . "    39.4537
<BOS> Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .    48.0666
<BOS> I will only add , God bless you .    39.5704
<BOS> In talking over their route the evening before , Mrs . Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .    29.5971
<BOS> These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .    32.1883
<BOS> Who should suffer but myself ?    138.0261
<BOS> Her hair so untidy , so blowsy ! "    20.8949
<BOS> " The country , " said Darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .    35.4522
<BOS> His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ?    43.8456
<BOS> Oh , sister !    69.6616
<BOS> If he fears me , why come hither ?    58.8819
<BOS> cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .    7.8636
<BOS> " My dear father , I congratulate you . "    11.3876
<BOS> " Exceed their income !    42.6558
<BOS> " This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , - - splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .    43.0100
<BOS> And his behaviour , so strikingly altered , - - what could it mean ?    29.0792
<BOS> " You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .    40.9201
<BOS> In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness . "    26.8680
<BOS> cried Miss Bingley .    12.6476
<BOS> " Mr . Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?    17.8228
<BOS> She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .    40.5768
<BOS> " Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?    30.6509
<BOS> " You may as well call it impertinence at once .    49.1868
<BOS> She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits .    20.9041
<BOS> Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner . '    60.2133
<BOS> she cried .    65.9674
<BOS> Mr . Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House .    26.3256
<BOS> Elizabeth could not help saying , " It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . "    13.7880
<BOS> I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr .    22.8031
<BOS> " Perhaps that is not possible for any one .    24.1857
<BOS> Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . "    59.6780
<BOS> Painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled .    44.4547
<BOS> It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .    26.8113
<BOS> It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go .    45.3336
<BOS> I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner .    30.1734
<BOS> " Not at all . "    8.4896
<BOS> " My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . "    21.3574
<BOS> Let us hope for better things .    55.5816
<BOS> Have not you always hated him ? "    21.0242
<BOS> " Mr . Collins moreover adds , " " I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known .    43.9305
<BOS> Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago .    38.9842
<BOS> what hours of transport we shall spend !    72.6466
<BOS> We must not all expect Jane's good fortune . "    41.6085
<BOS> she cried . - - " I , who have prided myself on my discernment ! - - I , who have valued myself on my abilities !    37.9347
<BOS> His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , - - allowing something for fortune and figure . "    46.3275
<BOS> Could there be finer symptoms ?    92.9583
<BOS> I am prodigiously proud of him .    13.3809
<BOS> Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield .    34.8835
<BOS> " But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow .    35.1345
<BOS> He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill - consequences of Lydia's flight , on her own folly alone .    34.9731
<BOS> I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier .    40.3170
<BOS> It was really a very handsome thought .    32.9622
<BOS> we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! "    46.7210
<BOS> With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? "    23.1219
<BOS> Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight .    126.5066
<BOS> If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . "    26.5313
<BOS> I dare say I shall soon see them here . "    17.7915
<BOS> There could not exist in the world two men , over whom Mr . Darcy could have such boundless influence .    29.0114
<BOS> In that case he would return no more .    36.5858
<BOS> Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare .    38.7488
<BOS> " Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added Charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . "    16.6020
<BOS> Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .    31.1405
<BOS> The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .    38.7215
<BOS> Who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ? "    43.8380
<BOS> Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .    44.8169
<BOS> " It is evident by this , " added Jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . "    13.8160
<BOS> In a doleful voice Mrs . Bennet thus began the projected conversation . - - " Oh !    20.1646
<BOS> I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .    30.8091
<BOS> " Now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy .    19.1355
<BOS> Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr . Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .    27.5569
<BOS> It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace .    16.7588
<BOS> He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !    32.7595
<BOS> " But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model .    31.2687
<BOS> He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .    49.8209
<BOS> Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .    12.8322
<BOS> Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .    37.0785
<BOS> You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created . "    18.6251
<BOS> With such rivals for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs . Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .    29.3149
<BOS> Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? "    37.9689
<BOS> Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . "    26.9575
<BOS> You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself - - for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . "    29.7081
<BOS> I promised them so faithfully !    45.6520
<BOS> Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .    26.5919
<BOS> They then went away .    11.5434
<BOS> " You appear to me , Mr . Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .    26.6727
<BOS> Well , how pleased I am !    42.3243
<BOS> But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .    56.5141
<BOS> My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . "    42.1167
<BOS> " Books - - Oh !    10.2748
<BOS> yes .    20.5288
<BOS> She had ventured only one glance at Darcy .    28.1061
<BOS> Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .    33.6735
<BOS> How is half such a sum to be repaid ? "    29.3848
<BOS> Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? "    58.0756
<BOS> She then took a large house in Edward - street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .    36.0942
<BOS> The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .    34.3323
<BOS> To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .    18.9728
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet rang the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library .    12.4966
<BOS> You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .    19.9602
<BOS> " One of them does . "    33.5137
<BOS> You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . "    23.3819
<BOS> " You have .    17.5037
<BOS> Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .    31.3764
<BOS> It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before .    31.2430
<BOS> Mr . Darcy , you cannot deny the fact . "    16.5246
<BOS> For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .    20.9813
<BOS> His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .    29.1639
<BOS> It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .    30.1027
<BOS> Well , any friend of Mr . Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . "    32.5338
<BOS> On Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .    17.8502
<BOS> As long as she stays there , it is all very well .    26.7990
<BOS> I enquired after their brother , of course .    22.1884
<BOS> Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this !    40.3883
<BOS> It was dated from Rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows : - - " Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you .    26.4600
<BOS> I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers .    16.3955
<BOS> But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London .    17.6480
<BOS> In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief .    36.6153
<BOS> " About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .    35.6008
<BOS> Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs . Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs . Bennet's sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .    35.6778
<BOS> Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . "    68.7204
<BOS> " May we take my uncle's letter to read to her ? "    26.4724
<BOS> However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves . "    25.5495
<BOS> The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr . Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love .    44.7397
<BOS> Don't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .    32.3006
<BOS> My poor father !    30.5685
<BOS> In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .    34.7324
<BOS> She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .    38.4059
<BOS> Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .    26.0554
<BOS> He came to tell Mr . Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr . Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once .    37.5375
<BOS> She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .    39.2562
<BOS> You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . "    18.3758
<BOS> I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .    29.6535
<BOS> " You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .    37.8303
<BOS> I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say .    23.8202
<BOS> You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . "    31.2782
<BOS> Mr . Bennet made no answer .    5.2217
<BOS> Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .    35.4854
<BOS> As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .    43.6476
<BOS> But these things happen so often !    53.2362
<BOS> Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .    18.8455
<BOS> He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs . Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .    47.1834
<BOS> He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother - in - law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .    28.7029
<BOS> And pray what sort of guardians do you make ?    41.8488
<BOS> To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .    82.0447
<BOS> But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish - - and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . - - Here you are in your own family . "    21.8150
<BOS> When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .    38.7923
<BOS> " Indeed you are mistaken .    10.9315
<BOS> Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the - - - - shire militia removed from Meryton ?    23.6195
<BOS> I never met with anybody who delighted me so much .    40.7113
<BOS> " Something very much to the purpose of course .    23.6544
<BOS> Mr . Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .    22.9162
<BOS> Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .    28.7221
<BOS> Mr . Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father's death , Mr . Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself . "    30.0504
<BOS> I am always glad to get a young person well placed out .    26.4544
<BOS> I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am .    28.8589
<BOS> " My dear Friend , " If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day's t te - - t te between two women can never end without a quarrel .    29.0903
<BOS> He has children of his own , and may have more .    35.3588
<BOS> Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr . Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening .    22.6757
<BOS> We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . "    21.3854
<BOS> On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? "    35.0984
<BOS> It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .    21.1092
<BOS> Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .    43.5574
<BOS> " I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Sir .    19.9240
<BOS> Mr . Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably .    31.6940
<BOS> But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion .    28.2422
<BOS> The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , Chatsworth , Dovedale , or the Peak .    30.3370
<BOS> Mrs . Hurst thought the same , and added , " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker .    21.9895
<BOS> With a stronger voice she soon added , " I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . "    25.8120
<BOS> The insipidity and yet the noise ; the nothingness and yet the self - importance of all these people ! - - What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! "    33.7666
<BOS> Mr . Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency .    17.8218
<BOS> on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford - - between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs . Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot - stool , that she said , ' Mr .    41.0317
<BOS> I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .    39.1792
<BOS> " I am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she .    9.8602
<BOS> " I confess , " said he , " that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings .    17.5739
<BOS> But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? "    23.2575
<BOS> Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .    27.8766
<BOS> I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane - - one does not often see any body better looking .    28.2035
<BOS> " I see what you are feeling , " replied Charlotte , - - " you must be surprised , very much surprised , - - so lately as Mr . Collins was wishing to marry you .    20.2373
<BOS> If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents .    18.8269
<BOS> The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your's . - - Do you draw ? "    31.7825
<BOS> These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .    87.9080
<BOS> Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .    52.4667
<BOS> The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .    37.8352
<BOS> Elizabeth went away with her head full of him .    19.0925
<BOS> But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?    19.9337
<BOS> " How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! "    31.6348
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .    10.6733
<BOS> Wickham only shook his head .    37.9584
<BOS> They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .    16.0531
<BOS> As she went up stairs to get ready , Mrs . Bennet followed her , saying , " I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself .    25.3458
<BOS> Darcy said very little , and Mr . Hurst nothing at all .    23.3243
<BOS> " I cannot make him out . - - There is something very pompous in his style . - - And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ? - - We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could . - - Can he be a sensible man , sir ? "    34.1095
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .    25.5179
<BOS> There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him .    32.5379
<BOS> " I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter .    24.8400
<BOS> " No , my dear ; I think not .    13.1806
<BOS> As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " Mr . Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? "    27.9127
<BOS> Your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . "    28.0293
<BOS> I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !    78.0182
<BOS> And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . "    20.6050
<BOS> " I would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried Bingley , " for a kingdom !    13.2120
<BOS> I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected .    67.1009
<BOS> " Thank you , " said Lydia , " for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . "    18.8102
<BOS> The effect was immediate .    38.1181
<BOS> " I am far from attributing any part of Mr . Bingley's conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .    27.5283
<BOS> His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .    27.1818
<BOS> He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . "    40.5167
<BOS> That lady I suppose is your mother . "    49.5239
<BOS> " That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance .    29.7263
<BOS> But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her .    35.4305
<BOS> I told my sister Philips so the other day .    33.1286
<BOS> " It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . "    35.1026
<BOS> " A great deal of good management , depend upon it .    16.5422
<BOS> I think I have heard you say that you know them . "    16.8440
<BOS> And taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , " Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . - - I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . "    27.1632
<BOS> " And your defect is a propensity to hate every body . "    16.5766
<BOS> That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible .    39.1419
<BOS> Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .    24.0600
<BOS> One ought not to repine ; - - but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me !    22.1551
<BOS> " It has been a very agreeable day , " said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth .    12.7813
<BOS> The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening .    30.5501
<BOS> " Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .    22.7087
<BOS> As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner : - - " You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .    17.2370
<BOS> " I honour your circumspection .    36.8669
<BOS> But I will not repine .    10.5383
<BOS> " The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . "    37.3552
<BOS> But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room .    23.8493
<BOS> There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again .    50.5467
<BOS> A person may be proud without being vain .    34.7056
<BOS> The first part of Mrs . Gardiner's business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .    23.3661
<BOS> " Take whatever you like , and get away . "    29.0290
<BOS> The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .    41.6395
<BOS> Their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses ' reach .    52.6594
<BOS> Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .    18.8448
<BOS> His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .    24.7809
<BOS> You know I have .    28.7163
<BOS> " What you ask , " said Elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr . Darcy had much better finish his letter . "    12.3090
<BOS> When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .    32.7373
<BOS> After tea , Mr . Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument .    17.3364
<BOS> At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters .    36.8812
<BOS> First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room .    27.4875
<BOS> " Your affectionate friend , " LYDIA BENNET . "    16.7242
<BOS> I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .    30.1918
<BOS> Poor Lydia's situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .    41.4847
<BOS> She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .    17.5731
<BOS> He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .    26.4056
<BOS> That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible .    35.4969
<BOS> At that moment , she cared for no other .    40.3693
<BOS> My aunt told me so herself on Saturday .    47.5462
<BOS> And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together .    39.4779
<BOS> There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter , which promises well .    22.1930
<BOS> " Yes - - if Darcy does not put it off again .    22.7246
<BOS> " It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty .    11.1467
<BOS> When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , " This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .    46.3467
<BOS> Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .    26.8201
<BOS> Collins ! "    22.0567
<BOS> I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . "    21.0457
<BOS> Other schemes too came into her head .    77.2653
<BOS> there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day .    36.1350
<BOS> I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .    35.2352
<BOS> " Certainly not . "    14.3929
<BOS> His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .    32.3407
<BOS> Till this moment , I never knew myself . "    20.1258
<BOS> You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .    27.1569
<BOS> " Mr . Darcy , you see , is the man !    22.6672
<BOS> " Yes - - that is what makes it amusing .    23.8557
<BOS> When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous .    32.6898
<BOS> This was not very consoling to Mrs . Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .    19.9002
<BOS> what has she to do with it ?    79.2315
<BOS> On being made acquainted with the present Mr . Darcy's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Mr . Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy .    45.5753
<BOS> And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .    19.1670
<BOS> " I cannot see why Mrs . Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , " said she , " though I am not her particular friend .    17.8213
<BOS> We do not suffer by accident .    29.4164
<BOS> " Do not you want to know who has taken it ? "    20.0555
<BOS> Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .    31.8759
<BOS> Its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned .    63.4952
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> Mamma would like to go too of all things !    84.6017
<BOS> " The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .    34.6679
<BOS> " Certainly .    13.9030
<BOS> This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .    29.9665
<BOS> Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .    38.7495
<BOS> Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement .    48.8990
<BOS> Mr .    24.9654
<BOS> You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . "    30.2684
<BOS> This , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal ; and it was settled that Mr . Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better .    23.2372
<BOS> I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy .    41.5279
<BOS> Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .    31.1131
<BOS> You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .    31.1761
<BOS> Mr . Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .    28.1283
<BOS> He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .    16.4079
<BOS> He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with Lydia , to send any message to her .    33.0306
<BOS> " With the officers ! "    17.5404
<BOS> He cannot know what Mr . Darcy is . "    9.9238
<BOS> They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .    49.5627
<BOS> If he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go .    38.4273
<BOS> I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .    32.5926
<BOS> After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr . Bennet coolly observed , " From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .    30.6357
<BOS> But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . "    26.9159
<BOS> This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .    84.3921
<BOS> And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing .    28.8205
<BOS> " I did not think you would ; - - and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion . "    24.8583
<BOS> On Saturday he came again .    29.0692
<BOS> Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . "    27.4518
<BOS> Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .    26.1321
<BOS> We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .    37.5416
<BOS> She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr . Darcy , she was directly retreating .    21.7802
<BOS> Mr . Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .    19.5211
<BOS> It is Mr . Wickham's intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .    33.0988
<BOS> I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her .    49.0819
<BOS> " You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . "    23.5315
<BOS> She now lost every expectation of pleasure .    28.4176
<BOS> " His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said Elizabeth angrily ; " for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr . Darcy's steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself . "    27.6672
<BOS> " It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye - lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . "    28.4815
<BOS> repeated Mr . Bennet .    13.7507
<BOS> There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .    33.0203
<BOS> " No - - why should he ?    21.9550
<BOS> The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .    36.1019
<BOS> Jane then took it from her pocket - book , and gave it to Elizabeth .    33.7644
<BOS> " Except , " thought Elizabeth , " when she goes to Ramsgate . "    14.7385
<BOS> So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him !    57.0537
<BOS> " In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either .    22.3939
<BOS> " I have no right to give my opinion , " said Wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise .    16.0411
<BOS> When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish .    32.0040
<BOS> " My dear Jane ! "    4.8350
<BOS> But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .    52.9917
<BOS> But pride - - where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation . "    28.0750
<BOS> The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs . Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out .    39.4373
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs . Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton .    26.0789
<BOS> " Has your governess left you ? "    29.9428
<BOS> It is of all subjects my delight .    44.5787
<BOS> Away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech .    56.9550
<BOS> You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . "    19.5005
<BOS> Collins must excuse me . - - He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .    25.1130
<BOS> He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman's daughter ; so far we are equal . "    31.4035
<BOS> What I have to say relates to poor Lydia .    51.3586
<BOS> But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .    33.3886
<BOS> Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity .    30.6507
<BOS> Ten thousand a year !    14.8469
<BOS> Consider Mr . Collins's respectability , and Charlotte's prudent , steady character .    38.4497
<BOS> I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town .    27.5756
<BOS> " I often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .    21.3652
<BOS> " I will go to Meryton , " said she , " as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips .    14.6310
<BOS> Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .    49.7444
<BOS> " I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .    29.0734
<BOS> But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation . "    16.7501
<BOS> Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .    41.5559
<BOS> " And Lydia used to want to go to London , " added Kitty .    26.3840
<BOS> " Aye - - because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; - - but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . "    26.8855
<BOS> Let me hear what it is . "    9.8790
<BOS> " Oh yes ! - - They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . "    54.7407
<BOS> Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .    27.5875
<BOS> Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it .    18.4979
<BOS> We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . "    24.6328
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .    25.6515
<BOS> Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . "    21.6752
<BOS> " You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .    33.8353
<BOS> Charlotte herself was tolerably composed .    69.8058
<BOS> The day passed much as the day before had done .    31.5238
<BOS> I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .    28.8141
<BOS> I told Mrs . Collins so before you came .    29.8307
<BOS> The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .    36.1477
<BOS> " Yes ; - - but he seemed to like his second better . "    19.0944
<BOS> If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !    46.8896
<BOS> cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner .    28.4000
<BOS> It was lady Catherine de Bourgh .    15.5186
<BOS> She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas .    39.1108
<BOS> Mr . Denny and Mr . Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr . Philips's house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs . Philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .    26.9502
<BOS> I cannot think so very ill of Wickham .    16.1711
<BOS> Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room , where Mrs . Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .    22.9626
<BOS> If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children , it should not be of my own however . "    34.4171
<BOS> On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of Jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared .    44.0790
<BOS> Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr . Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr . Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr . Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Mr . Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford .    29.2549
<BOS> " Certainly , Sir ; - - and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world . - - Every savage can dance . "    25.5249
<BOS> You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? "    12.6461
<BOS> His letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .    30.4870
<BOS> They insist also on my seeing Mr . Jones - - therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me - - and excepting a sore - throat and head - ache there is not much the matter with me .    35.0884
<BOS> Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .    29.9649
<BOS> Mr . Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread - bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .    31.5389
<BOS> I thought him very sly ; - - he hardly ever mentioned your name .    32.9238
<BOS> It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both - - - - " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! "    20.7352
<BOS> " Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .    30.0700
<BOS> It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .    41.7488
<BOS> I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs . Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano - forte in Mrs . Jenkinson's room .    26.5062
<BOS> Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .    22.8034
<BOS> Heaven forbid !    59.0864
<BOS> " He only told me , what I have now told you . "    15.3282
<BOS> Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline .    44.7639
<BOS> Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .    48.2108
<BOS> I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you . "    29.3044
<BOS> A small sum could not do all this . "    37.5453
<BOS> Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .    30.0848
<BOS> We had better go into the avenue . "    21.9582
<BOS> He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .    27.7151
<BOS> " Did Mr . Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? "    24.4060
<BOS> Heaven and earth ! - - of what are you thinking ?    24.2842
<BOS> Darcy . - - I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . "    20.9979
<BOS> On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , " Let me call your maid .    25.2091
<BOS> I shall like it of all things .    21.1110
<BOS> Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say .    12.1561
<BOS> " After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .    32.7852
<BOS> Elizabeth was delighted .    18.1425
<BOS> " I am sure I shall break mine , " said Lydia .    9.8493
<BOS> " Whatever my connections may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . "    16.8100
<BOS> Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object .    19.7028
<BOS> " That is the most unforgiving speech , " said Elizabeth , " that I ever heard you utter .    12.6938
<BOS> " It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . "    25.9195
<BOS> " My motive for cautioning you , is as follows .    22.8419
<BOS> As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .    36.5222
<BOS> Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?    57.6162
<BOS> I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance .    40.3700
<BOS> This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but Mrs . Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough .    29.3250
<BOS> " How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr . Darcy , " she cried ; " I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .    35.5809
<BOS> said Elizabeth .    9.5990
<BOS> " But consider your daughters .    36.6733
<BOS> Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .    22.0681
<BOS> Are the others coming out ? "    41.3549
<BOS> What are you telling Miss Bennet ?    39.6238
<BOS> His plan did not vary on seeing them . - - Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice .    33.1070
<BOS> She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ; - - and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .    41.7790
<BOS> The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .    46.1861
<BOS> " Can you come to - morrow ? "    13.9308
<BOS> But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing - room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .    14.8525
<BOS> She could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on .    34.2760
<BOS> Her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .    57.1541
<BOS> " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do . "    16.3558
<BOS> But it was not to be .    8.9311
<BOS> At length Darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " Mr . Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends - - whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . "    35.1487
<BOS> Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .    49.0057
<BOS> You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr . Bingley might like you the best of the party . "    33.4150
<BOS> " If your master would marry , you might see more of him . "    27.3486
<BOS> " You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr . Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet .    14.4520
<BOS> She could think only of her letter .    21.9878
<BOS> Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .    49.9351
<BOS> cried Miss Bingley , " Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .    29.8342
<BOS> Bingley ? "    14.2738
<BOS> The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants .    31.6010
<BOS> Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .    26.0000
<BOS> He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty .    19.5034
<BOS> " Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word . "    25.0660
<BOS> Not that I think Charlotte so very plain - - but then she is our particular friend . "    33.3443
<BOS> Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven !    74.4025
<BOS> " I never saw any one so shocked .    15.8948
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .    22.3566
<BOS> My dear Mr . Bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ?    10.8414
<BOS> Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your's .    25.2999
<BOS> Darcy ! "    10.2942
<BOS> " His misfortunes ! "    11.9742
<BOS> My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .    27.4835
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else .    24.9547
<BOS> I am the happiest creature in the world .    8.3127
<BOS> Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure .    39.5020
<BOS> With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .    37.0561
<BOS> " No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . "    13.0287
<BOS> Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .    55.4900
<BOS> She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before .    23.1517
<BOS> I will think no more about him . "    10.5170
<BOS> It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .    37.8911
<BOS> " Really , Mr . Collins , " cried Elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly .    13.3309
<BOS> Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . - - Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome .    39.1446
<BOS> The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .    16.1242
<BOS> " Perhaps we might be deceived . "    15.8480
<BOS> Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .    25.0053
<BOS> Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now .    24.6543
<BOS> Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .    37.7299
<BOS> She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .    37.0551
<BOS> " Mr . Darcy is not to be laughed at ! "    13.1284
<BOS> good or bad ? "    223.6415
<BOS> He is come - - Mr . Bingley is come . - - He is , indeed .    15.0632
<BOS> I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .    36.8097
<BOS> But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . "    37.5293
<BOS> susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough .    102.1556
<BOS> But make a virtue of it by all means .    38.2495
<BOS> You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr . Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .    38.5543
<BOS> She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous .    47.3581
<BOS> In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .    34.2753
<BOS> - - And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .    26.6051
<BOS> " Yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing .    23.2505
<BOS> All were struck with the stranger's air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot .    39.1751
<BOS> Their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs . Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her .    41.6290
<BOS> " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? "    24.3031
<BOS> " True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .    23.9706
<BOS> Mr . Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . "    38.8134
<BOS> It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed .    24.4024
<BOS> She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .    37.5479
<BOS> Your's , & c . " Mr . Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in reply to his last .    21.5881
<BOS> " And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma'am ? "    21.6579
<BOS> The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs . Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .    36.5591
<BOS> An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn .    24.8703
<BOS> I am perfectly satisfied .    10.8293
<BOS> To know that her daughter would be married was enough .    22.8954
<BOS> It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .    36.2735
<BOS> Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . - - Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .    43.1093
<BOS> Mrs . Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .    26.7858
<BOS> And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .    43.5126
<BOS> " You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .    24.4542
<BOS> With assumed tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success .    21.0086
<BOS> In revolving lady Catherine's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .    33.0303
<BOS> " Yes , very well .    8.6657
<BOS> " From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground - work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . "    35.9296
<BOS> Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .    47.8210
<BOS> She will be taken good care of .    53.8181
<BOS> Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both .    30.2555
<BOS> Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .    30.1377
<BOS> Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .    27.8668
<BOS> But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .    36.2267
<BOS> Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from P . I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park .    28.4728
<BOS> The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? - - Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? "    29.8515
<BOS> But I have other provocations .    26.1089
<BOS> But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .    22.3289
<BOS> " I hope , " added Mrs . Gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .    19.3511
<BOS> I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .    48.7884
<BOS> " No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . "    26.5183
<BOS> Lydia , my love , ring the bell .    41.3216
<BOS> You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . "    23.3867
<BOS> He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away .    25.1793
<BOS> Her ladyship was highly incensed .    17.0059
<BOS> So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next .    51.9507
<BOS> " If I had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her .    21.5266
<BOS> Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth .    30.3760
<BOS> " Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . "    33.3534
<BOS> " Very true ; and if I had my will , we should .    26.3657
<BOS> These recollections will not do at all .    21.0053
<BOS> Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first .    39.5503
<BOS> Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .    73.3487
<BOS> and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . "    57.6279
<BOS> cried Elizabeth .    7.3262
<BOS> Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr . Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under .    36.4129
<BOS> Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth .    30.7596
<BOS> In as short a time as Mr . Collins's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .    26.1159
<BOS> Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .    23.6120
<BOS> He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood - - the sort of preference which was often given me . "    31.1295
<BOS> The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .    26.7161
<BOS> From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him .    36.5585
<BOS> In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . "    48.5935
<BOS> Elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .    38.1215
<BOS> " So much the better .    21.1506
<BOS> " It is a long time , Mr . Bingley , since you went away , " said Mrs . Bennet .    7.7066
<BOS> At length the Parsonage was discernible .    20.5674
<BOS> Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained .    39.4494
<BOS> Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . "    58.7555
<BOS> Not a soul knew of it , but Col . and Mrs . Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked !    34.9972
<BOS> After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley's voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .    27.7662
<BOS> " They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . "    47.6801
<BOS> That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr . Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .    25.3489
<BOS> Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you .    42.7382
<BOS> Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .    29.1526
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but Mr . Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr . Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .    41.1283
<BOS> Why should they try to influence him ?    56.7918
<BOS> The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .    30.9727
<BOS> Elizabeth shook her head over this letter .    18.2578
<BOS> " This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! "    24.8386
<BOS> " But my father cannot . - - He wrote last week to hurry my return . "    34.9219
<BOS> Again she read on .    51.0916
<BOS> I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again .    27.1293
<BOS> And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .    37.7728
<BOS> They had frequently been staying with her in town .    30.5077
<BOS> " I do not mind his not talking to Mrs . Long , " said Miss Lucas , " but I wish he had danced with Eliza . "    18.5889
<BOS> It would be dreadful !    19.0925
<BOS> His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .    27.6374
<BOS> Compliments always take you by surprise , and me never .    75.3115
<BOS> cried Elizabeth .    7.3262
<BOS> But papa is so disagreeable . "    21.2282
<BOS> Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will .    48.1472
<BOS> " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? "    15.4518
<BOS> I knew that Mr . Wickham ought not to be a clergyman .    13.2545
<BOS> Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? "    33.8185
<BOS> If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better .    14.6138
<BOS> Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern .    36.5056
<BOS> In this danger Kitty is also comprehended .    83.3026
<BOS> Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? "    34.3471
<BOS> " Lizzy , you must not do so .    16.3461
<BOS> Sir William only smiled .    23.3687
<BOS> As soon as Jane had read Mr . Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .    41.9516
<BOS> and his answering immediately to the last question - - Oh !    44.2247
<BOS> I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . "    18.1210
<BOS> Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty .    30.9788
<BOS> People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true .    32.7839
<BOS> Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .    17.5826
<BOS> Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .    30.1241
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton .    17.4918
<BOS> When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte .    42.6395
<BOS> He cannot afford it .    25.7788
<BOS> It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . "    15.1783
<BOS> She is almost three and twenty !    38.0215
<BOS> " Not the slightest .    22.9676
<BOS> And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .    23.4358
<BOS> " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth .    24.6526
<BOS> " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? "    17.5238
<BOS> She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh !    21.4334
<BOS> I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses .    30.7861
<BOS> If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed .    45.7391
<BOS> I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . "    32.1553
<BOS> It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . "    25.2288
<BOS> I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . "    30.0069
<BOS> " No - - I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . "    15.8903
<BOS> " I do not recollect that we did . "    11.6947
<BOS> he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . "    40.4462
<BOS> To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .    33.4804
<BOS> " I believe she did - - and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . "    23.4589
<BOS> " About a month , " said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . "    21.8149
<BOS> They were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of Mrs . Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt .    23.6288
<BOS> They will take care not to outrun their income .    32.6364
<BOS> You have done all this !    16.2009
<BOS> Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . "    27.1753
<BOS> I do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . "    24.0225
<BOS> For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation .    30.8332
<BOS> She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give .    35.3945
<BOS> Good gracious !    30.4043
<BOS> " Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .    33.3362
<BOS> " Good gracious !    8.9593
<BOS> You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .    26.3934
<BOS> Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .    21.3595
<BOS> It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution . "    21.1963
<BOS> She wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .    20.1735
<BOS> Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing - room .    21.0239
<BOS> can it be really so !    105.4907
<BOS> of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance !    56.6181
<BOS> But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties . "    58.7076
<BOS> " He is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived .    12.5819
<BOS> But it is so strange ! "    8.9699
<BOS> And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .    75.2769
<BOS> Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough .    35.3962
<BOS> How are you all ? "    18.1101
<BOS> But , alas !    18.2162
<BOS> " If you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone .    16.1214
<BOS> Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .    40.3924
<BOS> I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine .    32.9643
<BOS> But I knew I should persuade you at last .    24.6718
<BOS> I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .    47.5366
<BOS> It was Mr . Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .    35.4958
<BOS> The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield .    25.3993
<BOS> Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? "    27.5750
<BOS> Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .    21.0878
<BOS> " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . "    20.7106
<BOS> My father , however , is partial to Mr . Wickham .    12.0692
<BOS> " Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? "    46.2467
<BOS> " I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied Jane , " and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .    20.9852
<BOS> On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .    32.5435
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .    35.6709
<BOS> I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes .    29.2791
<BOS> He now wished it more than ever .    27.3087
<BOS> My dear aunt , how could you think of it ?    13.8465
<BOS> He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .    35.4254
<BOS> In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .    32.5071
<BOS> I am so grieved for him .    9.7100
<BOS> He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex .    28.8507
<BOS> In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .    27.8969
<BOS> Mr . Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .    15.6790
<BOS> In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?    118.9290
<BOS> " I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , " said he .    32.7549
<BOS> But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew .    30.5229
<BOS> repeated Miss Bingley .    24.1257
<BOS> " I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ?    16.7372
<BOS> They are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines .    44.4287
<BOS> I cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . "    37.5127
<BOS> " Not that I shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . "    18.4945
<BOS> " Indeed , " replied Elizabeth , " I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .    19.8170
<BOS> " So , Lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love I find .    23.2351
<BOS> " Sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs . Bennet , alarmed .    15.8955
<BOS> Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party . - - " I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , " said Lady Catherine ; " I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do .    20.4448
<BOS> Why must their marriage be private ?    178.0704
<BOS> His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time .    43.2017
<BOS> " I am exceedingly gratified , " said Bingley , " by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .    25.2748
<BOS> His belief of her sister's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .    31.9374
<BOS> The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .    52.6609
<BOS> The business was therefore soon settled .    24.7455
<BOS> This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr . Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .    23.8836
<BOS> But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .    43.8768
<BOS> but the gentlemen will have Mr . Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton ; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . "    25.4425
<BOS> " Well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " I have no more to say .    8.5561
<BOS> After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant , there chanced to be a little alteration .    24.3601
<BOS> He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business .    21.2796
<BOS> His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter .    56.7612
<BOS> It was to this effect : " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you - - be assured that we are all well .    55.0851
<BOS> Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .    22.6033
<BOS> She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .    27.0442
<BOS> Change of scene might be of service - - and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . "    34.2920
<BOS> And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .    34.9904
<BOS> Mr . Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .    15.8794
<BOS> " I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . "    36.0992
<BOS> I cannot understand it .    14.9290
<BOS> After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .    59.9361
<BOS> He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former .    34.7524
<BOS> When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs . Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .    34.9224
<BOS> Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .    39.3923
<BOS> But that is one great difference between us .    40.8521
<BOS> for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts . "    61.3101
<BOS> It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the - - - - shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .    17.9730
<BOS> " The present always occupies you in such scenes - - does it ? "    33.5903
<BOS> His brother - in - law , Mr . Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr . Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .    34.1301
<BOS> He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .    40.2356
<BOS> And who knows what may happen ?    41.0684
<BOS> Yes , he had no engagement at all for to - morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .    34.8241
<BOS> March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .    38.2816
<BOS> It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .    33.1781
<BOS> The officers may not be so pleasant in General - - - - ' s regiment . "    14.7327
<BOS> When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .    35.3817
<BOS> Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party .    16.0512
<BOS> With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty's hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn .    34.8804
<BOS> Why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?    43.8476
<BOS> " Removed ! "    10.5181
<BOS> " Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?    26.1069
<BOS> My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr . Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .    34.6945
<BOS> The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .    28.1622
<BOS> They travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner - time the next day .    31.2676
<BOS> She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .    19.2191
<BOS> Their table was superlatively stupid .    43.8773
<BOS> I know we dine with four and twenty families . "    31.2536
<BOS> Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present .    30.1072
<BOS> At present I will say nothing about it . "    17.1273
<BOS> But of every other neglect I can believe him capable .    49.7105
<BOS> Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .    30.1359
<BOS> You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short lease . "    25.0536
<BOS> The loss of her daughter made Mrs . Bennet very dull for several days .    26.0121
<BOS> When they repaired to the dining - room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .    19.5971
<BOS> " I desire you will do no such thing .    26.1597
<BOS> " I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind .    19.7931
<BOS> has she any family ? "    155.0865
<BOS> " Good gracious ! "    6.8454
<BOS> " Your examination of Mr . Darcy is over , I presume , " said Miss Bingley ; - - " and pray what is the result ? "    11.8486
<BOS> " Are you , indeed ?    11.6419
<BOS> " And they must marry !    23.9344
<BOS> But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . - - That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , - - but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears . - - I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; - - I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . - - My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . - - But there were other causes of repugnance ; - - causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . - - These causes must be stated , though briefly . - - The situation of your mother's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father . - - Pardon me . - - It pains me to offend you .    43.6959
<BOS> Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .    24.6877
<BOS> We now come to the point .    26.1420
<BOS> If you love Mr . Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .    19.1247
<BOS> All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .    19.3777
<BOS> Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .    24.0048
<BOS> When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence .    37.8064
<BOS> " What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ?    12.5965
<BOS> One seems so forlorn without them . "    64.0538
<BOS> If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .    24.7823
<BOS> Mr . Bingley was good looking and gentleman - like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .    37.8205
<BOS> " And then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .    29.8204
<BOS> " A little . "    13.2231
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .    23.9190
<BOS> How I long to see her !    55.7629
<BOS> While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever .    35.9191
<BOS> " It is no such thing .    9.6524
<BOS> hang Kitty !    52.3724
<BOS> His sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion .    29.7052
<BOS> She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty .    20.2478
<BOS> " I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .    19.5315
<BOS> " I do not know .    4.3726
<BOS> " Are you not diverted ? "    14.5260
<BOS> " How can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !    13.0739
<BOS> " I admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed Mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . "    27.4782
<BOS> " Yes , very indifferent indeed , " said Elizabeth , laughingly .    13.6656
<BOS> He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention .    29.1172
<BOS> Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . "    27.3838
<BOS> " You need not distress yourself .    32.7352
<BOS> His temptation is not adequate to the risk . "    16.8033
<BOS> Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .    72.4018
<BOS> I speak nothing but the truth .    29.2945
<BOS> " Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . "    23.9856
<BOS> By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .    53.9048
<BOS> " What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?    76.9390
<BOS> " But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . "    30.6281
<BOS> and so did Mrs . Forster .    73.7473
<BOS> Mr . Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding .    21.7960
<BOS> To these high flown expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr . Bingley's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .    31.6908
<BOS> " Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . "    14.7198
<BOS> Affectation of candour is common enough ; - - one meets it every where .    84.4566
<BOS> The rector of a parish has much to do . - - In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .    30.2227
<BOS> From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr . Collins's side , and as many bows on Sir William's , they departed .    27.5909
<BOS> He placed himself by her .    44.7872
<BOS> Dear , dear Lizzy .    42.7521
<BOS> I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . "    18.7764
<BOS> If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .    55.3393
<BOS> At last it arrested her - - and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr . Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .    20.8554
<BOS> The officers will find women better worth their notice .    58.6726
<BOS> " And yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them . "    14.6506
<BOS> Is her husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?    25.1481
<BOS> I am not romantic you know .    14.2147
<BOS> I had not an idea of it . "    14.3103
<BOS> " And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .    25.9216
<BOS> Wickham is safe . "    24.1241
<BOS> But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .    28.3148
<BOS> I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .    28.7577
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July , and must be in London again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire .    37.7795
<BOS> After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference .    23.4294
<BOS> " I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself .    35.8067
<BOS> They must all go to Brighton .    27.8460
<BOS> She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .    21.1224
<BOS> She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .    28.1077
<BOS> I will take care of myself , and of Mr . Wickham too .    21.4265
<BOS> Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn .    39.5368
<BOS> " Yes , yes , they must marry .    14.4272
<BOS> " I did not know before , " continued Bingley immediately , " that you were a studier of character .    19.1425
<BOS> But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill . " Lydia declared herself satisfied .    43.2671
<BOS> cried Jane , " what do you mean , Sir ? "    10.9631
<BOS> " Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . "    20.9151
<BOS> cried Elizabeth .    7.3262
<BOS> Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal !    40.5282
<BOS> She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted .    24.7326
<BOS> He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . "    29.7721
<BOS> Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ? "    30.7931
<BOS> my dear , " cried his wife , " I cannot bear to hear that mentioned .    11.9501
<BOS> But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them .    27.6901
<BOS> Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay .    19.7457
<BOS> His character was to speak for itself .    36.4976
<BOS> This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . "    24.4536
<BOS> Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him . "    23.8018
<BOS> If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . "    28.2594
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs . Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr . Bingley's continued absence .    36.2787
<BOS> More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .    58.3529
<BOS> " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .    33.3191
<BOS> She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .    26.7105
<BOS> " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved - - shocked .    14.8712
<BOS> " I can easily believe it .    8.5621
<BOS> Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit .    50.5424
<BOS> " And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? "    33.5183
<BOS> It will pass away soon enough . "    27.7163
<BOS> " We will go as far as Meryton with you , " said Catherine and Lydia . - - Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .    29.1284
<BOS> Why , he has four or five thousand a - year , and very likely more . "    28.7647
<BOS> Well , well , I only hope it will last .    38.6826
<BOS> I guessed as much . "    24.4477
<BOS> " It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas .    19.0663
<BOS> When I last saw her , she was not very promising .    28.6949
<BOS> I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . "    34.3247
<BOS> Mr . Wickham's attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh .    23.4260
<BOS> And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs . Long .    21.3752
<BOS> Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ?    54.5581
<BOS> But at length , by Elizabeth's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .    25.9790
<BOS> I believe I have now told you every thing .    20.4535
<BOS> She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .    24.4028
<BOS> But my dear Lydia , I don't at all like your going such a way off .    30.7688
<BOS> I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .    21.1893
<BOS> Her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .    27.6965
<BOS> She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .    31.1186
<BOS> He does not want abilities .    41.0382
<BOS> She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters .    71.5282
<BOS> But don't imagine it was from any silly cause .    116.6229
<BOS> The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon .    34.4533
<BOS> He would scarcely be ten pounds a - year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother's hands , Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum .    48.9049
<BOS> Mr . Bennet's expectations were fully answered .    21.3971
<BOS> When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .    27.3986
<BOS> I never saw such a long chin in my life .    17.1170
<BOS> At such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . "    29.5400
<BOS> Mr . Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , & c . Mrs . Bennet was quite disconcerted .    14.2343
<BOS> He heard her attentively , and then said , " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . "    30.1876
<BOS> There was also a postscript to this effect .    28.8823
<BOS> To the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr . Bingley's , she could not make a very favourable answer .    35.1057
<BOS> How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .    42.1724
<BOS> " You quite mistook Mr . Darcy .    14.6775
<BOS> " Where is your sister ? "    10.5528
<BOS> By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , - - but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .    39.1452
<BOS> I saw them the night before last . "    25.8230
<BOS> On both sides it was only assertion .    45.4744
<BOS> " But if you have got them to - day , " said Elizabeth , " my mother's purpose will be answered . "    15.9909
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .    28.2183
<BOS> " But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said Jane .    13.0071
<BOS> Mr . Wickham began to speak on more general topics , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .    43.3256
<BOS> " That is as it happens .    17.3222
<BOS> Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .    38.2022
<BOS> However little Mr . Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , - - no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .    39.0183
<BOS> Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .    25.9565
<BOS> But she would not be secure .    18.4841
<BOS> As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt , and all Mr . Collins's scruples of leaving Mr . and Mrs . Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing - room , that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation , and was then in the house .    24.6164
<BOS> " What do you mean , Hill ?    11.4352
<BOS> I am sorry to pain you - - but so it was .    17.2285
<BOS> " And do you impute it to either of those ? "    21.3807
<BOS> " You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate . "    20.9987
<BOS> " You were Mr . Bingley's first choice . "    18.3928
<BOS> They were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something !    45.3391
<BOS> " No , not at all . "    10.7921
<BOS> He was most highly esteemed by Mr . Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .    25.8502
<BOS> I am impatient to see him . "    6.8957
<BOS> What is to become of us !    53.8475
<BOS> She smiled , but made no answer .    13.9713
<BOS> The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch .    30.1142
<BOS> " Of music !    38.7984
<BOS> The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing - room .    23.8439
<BOS> What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?    73.9499
<BOS> I am sure you must feel it so . "    7.9643
<BOS> From what can it proceed ?    32.0173
<BOS> " In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . "    21.9396
<BOS> Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .    42.8808
<BOS> During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .    23.3809
<BOS> Thank Heaven !    26.0103
<BOS> At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .    23.8540
<BOS> forgive the question - - are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? "    24.0157
<BOS> The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .    41.1220
<BOS> Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; - - she knew not how to believe that Mr . Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr . Bingley's regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . - - The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .    31.8591
<BOS> Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes .    26.9859
<BOS> But she is nothing to me now .    18.9559
<BOS> She shook her head .    10.0031
<BOS> If you'll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight .    55.7603
<BOS> Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .    21.1822
<BOS> " Yes , " thought Elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .    20.1083
<BOS> With them he is remarkably agreeable . "    40.9606
<BOS> She saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .    46.4217
<BOS> I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .    35.3156
<BOS> He was very fond of them . "    10.6291
<BOS> Who would have thought it !    28.7005
<BOS> Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence .    82.9787
<BOS> When her mother went up to her dressing - room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication .    20.3017
<BOS> You promised me to insist upon her marrying him . "    17.6389
<BOS> Such very superior dancing is not often seen .    76.8364
<BOS> Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself .    27.9661
<BOS> But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .    37.3239
<BOS> Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .    63.0742
<BOS> Those were your words .    68.3975
<BOS> She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .    30.8648
<BOS> " And my mother - - How is she ?    18.8112
<BOS> If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .    19.8219
<BOS> The moral will be perfectly fair .    25.3081
<BOS> Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .    27.1977
<BOS> Yet he is such a man ! "    11.0236
<BOS> but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !    52.4501
<BOS> Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs . Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair .    38.2206
<BOS> The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn .    35.8900
<BOS> When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .    34.6596
<BOS> Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .    27.3162
<BOS> Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs . Bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .    39.6565
<BOS> " Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . "    55.6081
<BOS> " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship's residence . "    36.0387
<BOS> I know it all ; that the young man's marrying her , was a patched - up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .    38.1195
<BOS> What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to - morrow evening .    32.2245
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> " But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .    40.8294
<BOS> Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . - - If it be so , if I have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable .    26.7004
<BOS> " Miss Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , " despises cards .    12.2067
<BOS> " You have insulted me , in every possible method .    18.2432
<BOS> said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone .    11.0420
<BOS> But Elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .    26.8011
<BOS> And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?    48.4863
<BOS> That he was not a good - tempered man , had been her firmest opinion .    22.5687
<BOS> " I should not mind any thing at all . "    12.5366
<BOS> People do not die of little trifling colds .    31.3733
<BOS> The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Mrs . Forster , the delight of Mrs . Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described .    19.8317
<BOS> You have employed your time much better .    48.7915
<BOS> But I dare not hope it .    16.4184
<BOS> Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . "    50.7597
<BOS> He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .    36.5735
<BOS> " There can be no doubt of that .    18.7231
<BOS> They must be a great loss to your family . "    13.3331
<BOS> My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I can't write ; so I will dictate , and you write for me .    18.7172
<BOS> " Indeed I had .    21.5360
<BOS> Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust - - any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .    38.1137
<BOS> Ever since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it .    30.6765
<BOS> Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related .    48.7241
<BOS> It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .    34.4631
<BOS> cried Mrs . Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley !    25.2745
<BOS> said she .    17.2817
<BOS> It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it .    29.1975
<BOS> Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano - forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .    35.9527
<BOS> You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs . Collins .    19.3829
<BOS> said he , smiling .    30.1292
<BOS> " Oh , no ! "    12.9229
<BOS> Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .    56.7119
<BOS> " Very , very much .    22.3136
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet's best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer .    18.6455
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> she added , " by far too much .    26.3350
<BOS> It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .    30.2941
<BOS> Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .    37.0513
<BOS> And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment's concern - - and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . "    27.4061
<BOS> the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair .    32.0326
<BOS> " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter .    48.3075
<BOS> Their manners are not equal to his . "    23.8493
<BOS> But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . "    15.4764
<BOS> observed Mrs . Bennet .    17.3100
<BOS> You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr . Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .    31.4945
<BOS> Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression .    60.8987
<BOS> Perhaps I am not doing her justice .    20.7271
<BOS> She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin .    32.1049
<BOS> Darcy . "    8.5963
<BOS> " Well , well , and so Mr . Bingley is coming down , sister , " ( for Mrs . Philips first brought her the news . )    43.5126
<BOS> " Then , who taught you ?    40.2508
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> Darcy ! - - There is nothing like dancing after all . - - I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . "    19.0727
<BOS> Yes , yes .    26.5417
<BOS> After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer .    33.0122
<BOS> " I should imagine not . "    21.5920
<BOS> All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .    54.8678
<BOS> " When you have killed all your own birds , Mr . Bingley , " said her mother , " I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Mr . Bennet's manor .    15.5578
<BOS> You have delighted us long enough .    31.9748
<BOS> She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .    25.2582
<BOS> The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .    47.1481
<BOS> Yes , I call it a very easy distance . "    24.9976
<BOS> Mr . Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's .    19.9818
<BOS> " You shall have it in few words .    37.3543
<BOS> I know it to be impossible . "    8.8248
<BOS> " True .    9.6533
<BOS> They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . "    46.2371
<BOS> " You begin to comprehend me , do you ? "    15.0901
<BOS> You have sense , and we all expect you to use it .    43.0395
<BOS> An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! - - Imagine our surprise .    38.8557
<BOS> She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .    20.7890
<BOS> ' Tis as good as a Lord !    20.5457
<BOS> As Mrs . Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it .    19.4424
<BOS> " Yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " I remember hearing you once say , Mr . Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .    34.1224
<BOS> She finds Miss Pope a treasure .    43.0747
<BOS> One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .    31.9496
<BOS> Mrs . Hill began instantly to express her joy .    35.5150
<BOS> And one of my own daughters .    16.9974
<BOS> Elizabeth was distressed .    20.2708
<BOS> I am very glad you liked her .    14.7609
<BOS> On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion .    30.6673
<BOS> When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . - - Elizabeth's courage did not fail her .    29.5239
<BOS> It convinced her , that accident only could discover to Mr . Bingley her sister's being in town .    39.5427
<BOS> " He is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! - - so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! "    22.3505
<BOS> " She is a very good kind of girl , I believe .    10.7942
<BOS> The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . "    39.0162
<BOS> Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?    39.8933
<BOS> " There is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said Kitty ; " who can it be ? "    13.9962
<BOS> I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .    32.5838
<BOS> Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to - - - - You shall try it some day . - - Do your sisters play and sing ? "    31.2678
<BOS> " I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .    27.7283
<BOS> so genteel and so easy ! - - He has always something to say to every body . - - That is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . "    44.2000
<BOS> For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy's , but you shall do as you chuse . "    22.5231
<BOS> Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr . Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself .    30.1068
<BOS> cried he , turning towards her .    27.4885
<BOS> But enough of this .    48.0639
<BOS> " He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .    21.0204
<BOS> " And how impossible in others ! "    49.7660
<BOS> We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . "    47.8159
<BOS> Mr . Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .    32.2761
<BOS> Let me never see either one or the other again ! "    39.9889
<BOS> it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr . Collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .    24.2180
<BOS> " Aye - - that is because you have the right disposition .    31.8564
<BOS> You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage .    38.7223
<BOS> Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .    20.2217
<BOS> She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment's pause , added , " My eldest sister has been in town these three months .    24.7446
<BOS> How wonderfully these sort of things occur !    68.6686
<BOS> Her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to Elizabeth's wishes , for she was impatient to get home .    24.3077
<BOS> " Oh , yes !    8.0279
<BOS> " I hope not . "    12.3427
<BOS> He has the promise of an ensigncy in General - - - - ' s regiment , now quartered in the North .    15.7451
<BOS> He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .    25.7468
<BOS> The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .    33.8995
<BOS> They are my old friends .    42.7618
<BOS> I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .    35.1106
<BOS> No thanks to his gallantry for that .    69.5512
<BOS> Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the - - - - shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do .    16.2310
<BOS> This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .    34.7202
<BOS> Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?    46.6531
<BOS> The dejection was almost universal .    37.0097
<BOS> Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs . Bennet instantly answered , " Oh dear ! - - Yes - - certainly . - - I am sure Lizzy will be very happy - - I am sure she can have no objection . - - Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs . "    22.7209
<BOS> When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .    28.8417
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income .    34.8974
<BOS> With many compliments to them , and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , - - to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs . Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , " Good Lord !    35.7396
<BOS> On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .    55.4746
<BOS> They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane's perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super - excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .    32.1768
<BOS> Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece .    45.0430
<BOS> " Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say .    11.2053
<BOS> Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .    39.8715
<BOS> After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr . Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday .    36.4983
<BOS> I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .    38.0779
<BOS> He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her .    40.9746
<BOS> We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .    35.1752
<BOS> " Dearest Jane !    24.9255
<BOS> I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .    30.9516
<BOS> He should be particularly happy at any time , & c . & c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .    20.3648
<BOS> " But I can assure you , " she added , " that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .    27.4653
<BOS> " Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room . "    20.1395
<BOS> Her report was highly favourable .    34.9615
<BOS> May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? "    58.1768
<BOS> It was all pride and insolence .    20.0665
<BOS> " If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " I shall know how to understand it .    22.6477
<BOS> But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .    31.2360
<BOS> Sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .    37.8729
<BOS> They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better .    85.6255
<BOS> After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr . Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner , though unknown .    22.5637
<BOS> Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .    39.3895
<BOS> " To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart .    36.9243
<BOS> he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! "    31.4306
<BOS> What a contrast between him and his friend !    26.1704
<BOS> And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow's debts , and got him his commission !    55.9660
<BOS> Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr . Collins , in describing the civility of Mr . and Mrs . Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .    30.2218
<BOS> Mr . Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels . - - Kitty stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . - - Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons .    36.7485
<BOS> Younger sons cannot marry where they like . "    79.1645
<BOS> Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .    38.7445
<BOS> In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London .    22.9171
<BOS> From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .    30.7606
<BOS> it cannot be .    47.8542
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> " It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the - - - - shire .    15.7162
<BOS> A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . "    47.9660
<BOS> After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .    27.7505
<BOS> The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs . Bennet's ill humour or ill health .    38.3457
<BOS> I am not ashamed of having been mistaken - - or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .    24.1088
<BOS> I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies .    51.5644
<BOS> Mr . Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .    13.3350
<BOS> Every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch .    38.1680
<BOS> She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . "    27.9793
<BOS> They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him .    21.9199
<BOS> " I must ask whether you were surprised ? "    17.3820
<BOS> His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half - expectation which Mrs . Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .    40.8914
<BOS> " Your's sincerely , & c . " Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .    24.5861
<BOS> He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney - coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom .    56.2641
<BOS> But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman - like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way .    32.1184
<BOS> I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend , WILLIAM COLLINS . "    56.3516
<BOS> Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .    38.1109
<BOS> His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile .    19.1578
<BOS> Rendered spiritless by the ill - success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother - in - law's intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit .    38.4131
<BOS> On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects .    26.4413
<BOS> The housekeeper came ; a respectable - looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .    32.6259
<BOS> Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives .    37.2573
<BOS> But think no more of the letter .    17.2617
<BOS> " Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . "    17.9645
<BOS> I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .    42.5254
<BOS> They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street .    24.4974
<BOS> " And of your infliction , " cried Elizabeth with energy .    13.7760
<BOS> Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .    43.8711
<BOS> He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman's family .    22.3673
<BOS> " That is right . - - You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .    27.6883
<BOS> " You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr .    42.3724
<BOS> " Mr . Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .    22.7140
<BOS> " No .    12.0159
<BOS> The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .    43.9388
<BOS> Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away .    37.8778
<BOS> I do not deserve it .    8.7859
<BOS> But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place - - which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years .    39.6102
<BOS> While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her .    30.6276
<BOS> Lydia laughed , and said , " Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .    37.4105
<BOS> What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr . Bingley - - is not he ?    34.6314
<BOS> Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .    31.9210
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet's eyes sparkled . - - " A gentleman and a stranger !    18.9434
<BOS> But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you .    21.2242
<BOS> Jane was not happy .    21.5350
<BOS> She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .    34.7651
<BOS> He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .    29.4237
<BOS> " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them - - by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . "    42.7805
<BOS> It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice - - a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .    43.6679
<BOS> You must not suspect me .    18.0298
<BOS> " Gracechurch - street , Monday , August <NUMBER> .    32.7228
<BOS> To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations .    35.2070
<BOS> " All ! - - What , all five out at once ?    34.3110
<BOS> " That is very strange .    8.2835
<BOS> But there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .    29.0074
<BOS> Lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard , and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him .    43.5207
<BOS> " My dear , dear Lizzy , I would - - I do congratulate you - - but are you certain ?    18.4963
<BOS> His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .    45.7188
<BOS> His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear .    57.9434
<BOS> His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .    35.5580
<BOS> That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny .    30.4836
<BOS> But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . "    18.1568
<BOS> What relates to yourself , is as follows .    27.9888
<BOS> " If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . "    24.5216
<BOS> Risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . "    36.7814
<BOS> " Your friend performs delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; - - " and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr .    30.3852
<BOS> All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again .    51.2950
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> " No , " said her father , " Wickham's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .    18.9862
<BOS> I believe him to be Lady Catherine's nephew .    20.6824
<BOS> The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr . Wickham's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .    39.9743
<BOS> She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .    23.5057
<BOS> He owns it himself without disguise . "    40.2806
<BOS> Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .    41.1190
<BOS> " Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . "    28.2687
<BOS> What did Colonel Forster say ?    56.1013
<BOS> Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !    52.1519
<BOS> " How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year !    29.4057
<BOS> " I have sent for you on an affair of importance .    33.8330
<BOS> " You can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered .    21.1828
<BOS> I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent .    26.6229
<BOS> He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .    55.2631
<BOS> It was only said , ' Lately , George Wickham , Esq .    33.4325
<BOS> I could hardly keep my countenance .    21.3975
<BOS> Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .    38.0765
<BOS> Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .    26.5830
<BOS> " No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .    16.5534
<BOS> " You did !    17.5568
<BOS> " Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! "    14.6737
<BOS> Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .    9.8274
<BOS> How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book ! - - When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . "    22.7582
<BOS> cried Bingley .    12.8047
<BOS> I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .    29.3335
<BOS> Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced .    39.6240
<BOS> Stay , stay , I will go myself .    50.5048
<BOS> The particulars , I reserve till we meet .    44.6988
<BOS> " I certainly shall not .    18.5218
<BOS> where is your sash my dear ? "    42.1808
<BOS> It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .    40.2007
<BOS> But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ?    27.9191
<BOS> " It is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .    11.6512
<BOS> Had the late Mr . Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him I believe very early in life .    46.4486
<BOS> The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .    18.7797
<BOS> and it was not wholly without foundation .    48.9036
<BOS> It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . "    64.2444
<BOS> " Implacable resentment is a shade in a character .    42.0483
<BOS> You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him .    21.9221
<BOS> From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . - - Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr . Collins , and I will never see you again if you do . "    16.4998
<BOS> At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .    63.4362
<BOS> Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? "    18.4913
<BOS> You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be dissuaded from it .    35.3808
<BOS> She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .    27.1842
<BOS> " No " - - said Darcy , " I have made no such pretension .    18.3814
<BOS> I must find Mr . Gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . "    29.6973
<BOS> I am not at all afraid of her dying .    13.7862
<BOS> As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .    23.2407
<BOS> " Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . "    23.5988
<BOS> The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .    33.8771
<BOS> In the dining - room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before .    25.1785
<BOS> While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr . Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .    32.7505
<BOS> You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . "    28.4624
<BOS> But that gentleman , " looking at Darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all . "    24.3793
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved .    84.5795
<BOS> said she , as she looked in her face .    14.5449
<BOS> " Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when that will be .    17.2430
<BOS> The hall , the dining - room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs . Bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .    28.8887
<BOS> " Nor I , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley .    9.0594
<BOS> He bore it however with admirable calmness .    33.5983
<BOS> Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before they did .    39.2820
<BOS> " No - - I cannot talk of books in a ball - room ; my head is always full of something else . "    20.5842
<BOS> In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach .    32.1424
<BOS> Mrs . Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not .    34.4380
<BOS> But no such recollection befriended her .    43.3959
<BOS> He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . "    31.8409
<BOS> " My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you .    19.9750
<BOS> " It is wonderful , " - - replied Wickham , - - " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; - - and pride has often been his best friend .    30.0026
<BOS> The discussion of Mr . Collins's offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .    35.6434
<BOS> But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .    47.2826
<BOS> He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .    20.9712
<BOS> she repeated .    80.6055
<BOS> The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again .    19.9217
<BOS> Mr . Darcy bowed .    9.9138
<BOS> But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .    16.4457
<BOS> Mr . Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain .    33.9058
<BOS> His reception however was of the most flattering kind .    47.7295
<BOS> " But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well . "    21.6931
<BOS> Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .    30.2147
<BOS> It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .    29.7749
<BOS> said Jane . - - " I certainly saw Mr . Darcy speaking to her . "    16.7803
<BOS> She was wild to be at home - - to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .    40.8144
<BOS> You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . "    13.0145
<BOS> Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner smiled .    12.2180
<BOS> I write rather slowly . "    33.3362
<BOS> I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise .    32.1984
<BOS> And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away .    17.2951
<BOS> It is Mr . Bingley I am sure .    14.6591
<BOS> and what can he have to say ? "    34.8667
<BOS> " How so ?    62.7939
<BOS> A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .    46.8765
<BOS> Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! )    72.4178
<BOS> " I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but I always speak what I think . "    24.5084
<BOS> But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! - - They were excessively sorry to go !    21.9613
<BOS> Mrs . Collins knew not what to make of him .    23.1412
<BOS> He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings .    25.8907
<BOS> He meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .    22.4766
<BOS> " You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short silence .    22.9123
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in .    89.0301
<BOS> You are so strange !    12.2737
<BOS> She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .    46.3571
<BOS> Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .    44.0225
<BOS> " Good heavens ! "    10.2553
<BOS> " Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? "    40.9881
<BOS> If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .    22.8777
<BOS> After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her - - " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? "    32.9617
<BOS> But do not imagine that he is always here so often .    20.3237
<BOS> " That is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .    23.3134
<BOS> I know you will contrive it all . "    20.2653
<BOS> When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr .    40.6587
<BOS> She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's , he might become a very agreeable companion .    42.0316
<BOS> I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . "    16.4619
<BOS> It is from my cousin , Mr . Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . "    18.7908
<BOS> It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do .    37.9082
<BOS> No one made any reply .    57.5360
<BOS> They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs . Bennet's civilities .    37.5310
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner left them soon after breakfast .    15.6671
<BOS> " What can be the meaning of this ! "    11.8133
<BOS> Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do .    51.4269
<BOS> Mr . Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother's fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his .    40.5466
<BOS> " Ah !    7.2183
<BOS> Mr . Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter .    17.6588
<BOS> The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected .    28.1198
<BOS> I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .    31.8149
<BOS> Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! "    69.3861
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> And a special licence .    23.2516
<BOS> " It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .    33.9577
<BOS> The t te - - t te surprised them .    11.8271
<BOS> Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance .    38.1076
<BOS> I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him .    26.6751
<BOS> " Your first position is false .    26.7467
<BOS> She was very equal therefore to address Mr . Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .    21.6666
<BOS> " In what an amiable light does this place him ! "    48.8324
<BOS> Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well - bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs . Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .    35.0492
<BOS> I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .    38.2772
<BOS> She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . "    27.9608
<BOS> At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . "    22.8372
<BOS> And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .    54.4985
<BOS> Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . "    30.1537
<BOS> The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .    14.6636
<BOS> Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?    43.7297
<BOS> " But , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .    26.7715
<BOS> His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .    50.3738
<BOS> Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . "    29.5997
<BOS> " What an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut .    24.6783
<BOS> Pray , how violent was Mr . Bingley's love ? "    40.4461
<BOS> But why Mr . Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .    26.9642
<BOS> Assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable .    44.3622
<BOS> No , never .    91.3541
<BOS> However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .    40.9596
<BOS> That he has neither integrity nor honour .    40.0426
<BOS> I shall offer to pay him to - morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . "    15.2289
<BOS> The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country .    30.6823
<BOS> " For heaven's sake , madam , speak lower . - - What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr .    62.0982
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .    26.0914
<BOS> How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? "    65.0199
<BOS> I cannot think of it without abhorrence . "    12.8380
<BOS> There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .    29.1923
<BOS> yes , " said Elizabeth drily - - " Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr . Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . "    14.6337
<BOS> " What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! "    16.9732
<BOS> Darcy had walked away to another part of the room .    18.2464
<BOS> Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .    31.2736
<BOS> They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain . "    26.2093
<BOS> " I dare say you will find him very agreeable . "    9.5929
<BOS> Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ?    57.2853
<BOS> Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .    23.1350
<BOS> With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining - parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee .    20.9649
<BOS> But Mr . Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .    42.6323
<BOS> To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go .    16.9420
<BOS> " Why did not you all learn ? - - You ought all to have learned .    22.3611
<BOS> Well , much good may it do them !    111.8769
<BOS> " To be sure , Lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .    23.8219
<BOS> " Haye - Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off !    31.0258
<BOS> - - My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England .    32.2753
<BOS> It was a fortnight since Mrs . Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .    26.3768
<BOS> " All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . "    39.1494
<BOS> Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .    14.3214
<BOS> Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .    20.1321
<BOS> to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing .    44.9367
<BOS> Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me .    16.7101
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party .    24.2572
<BOS> But the clothes , the wedding clothes !    49.9595
<BOS> I was never more annoyed !    38.2481
<BOS> The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !    38.5776
<BOS> On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr . Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .    41.8072
<BOS> " DEAR SIR , " I must trouble you once more for congratulations .    45.1928
<BOS> With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr . Darcy afterwards discharged .    35.2739
<BOS> thought she .    157.7023
<BOS> " I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two .    21.7774
<BOS> " This is an evening of wonders , indeed !    21.4983
<BOS> So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . "    25.5479
<BOS> Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr . Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , endurable to Kitty and Lydia .    39.6093
<BOS> I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it .    49.3178
<BOS> Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .    86.6814
<BOS> " While I can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . - - I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .    23.6702
<BOS> " My dear , you flatter me .    11.1535
<BOS> They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .    29.1072
<BOS> Her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .    42.1895
<BOS> In a few minutes , Mrs . Bennet half opened the door and called out , " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . "    10.8922
<BOS> She does not yet leave her dressing - room .    17.2706
<BOS> - - said Jane as she finished it .    33.1933
<BOS> As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .    44.1559
<BOS> The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr . Bennet's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .    22.2267
<BOS> When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .    25.7734
<BOS> " A man who had felt less , might . "    41.9429
<BOS> The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .    22.4388
<BOS> yes ; - - there is nothing in that .    22.2949
<BOS> " No , indeed , I did not . - - I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections .    15.5051
<BOS> He made no answer .    5.4022
<BOS> Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty - headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .    36.5825
<BOS> Wretched , wretched , mistake ! "    66.2797
<BOS> Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . '    29.2130
<BOS> " Well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ?    14.7646
<BOS> With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .    85.3846
<BOS> " Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . - - No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .    28.7929
<BOS> She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .    25.8659
<BOS> At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing .    31.3020
<BOS> I dare say Mr . Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . "    26.1731
<BOS> Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .    38.1073
<BOS> " Who do you mean , my dear ?    10.9400
<BOS> " You are a good girl ; " he replied , " and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .    15.3540
<BOS> But let me advise you to think better of it .    19.8604
<BOS> " Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? "    18.5802
<BOS> At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration .    26.3481
<BOS> " But what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? - - what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? "    17.2939
<BOS> Mr . and Mrs . Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys - - and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . "    40.7569
<BOS> " You certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . "    18.5686
<BOS> cried Jane .    14.6610
<BOS> " Wickham so very bad !    32.2572
<BOS> And what sort of table do they keep ?    76.8665
<BOS> " And Mary King is safe ! "    38.7687
<BOS> The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .    31.2803
<BOS> As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .    27.1076
<BOS> " Probably not ; - - but Mr . Darcy can please where he chuses .    24.3760
<BOS> " Mr . Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? - - Poor Eliza ! - - to be only just tolerable . "    30.8664
<BOS> Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs . Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " Lord , how tired I am ! "    49.5914
<BOS> Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr . Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .    32.8086
<BOS> But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? - - Mr .    56.5516
<BOS> She had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome .    27.9155
<BOS> Mrs . Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .    28.6069
<BOS> " I want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's , " what you have learnt about Mr . Wickham .    20.4405
<BOS> She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .    30.1666
<BOS> " Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully .    23.0728
<BOS> But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . "    34.4492
<BOS> " That is a question which Mr . Darcy only can answer . "    16.8201
<BOS> Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley's friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me .    63.0972
<BOS> His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !    39.4892
<BOS> Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude - - for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .    45.8606
<BOS> I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr . Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .    23.2700
<BOS> She could think of nothing but of Mr . Wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr . Collins were once silent .    32.3149
<BOS> " No ; but it must be done soon . "    13.8885
<BOS> Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .    71.5300
<BOS> " It is well .    10.3482
<BOS> A house in town !    31.6131
<BOS> " If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . "    20.8884
<BOS> I depend on you for that . "    36.4317
<BOS> But there are two things that I want very much to know : - - one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . "    32.8050
<BOS> But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .    25.8499
<BOS> said he , with a look of doubt .    28.4602
<BOS> Mr . Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .    11.9184
<BOS> and having to relate such a thing of his sister !    54.5702
<BOS> " It must not be thought of .    28.0628
<BOS> Even Elizabeth began to fear - - not that Bingley was indifferent - - but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .    30.5368
<BOS> I wish I could see her .    21.8421
<BOS> " You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; - - if the first , I should be completely in your way ; - - and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . "    47.7337
<BOS> On Miss Lucas's persevering , however , she added , " Very well ; if it must be so , it must . "    19.4071
<BOS> During dinner , Mr . Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .    29.7113
<BOS> Sir William did not say much .    16.1053
<BOS> He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company .    28.1180
<BOS> Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .    40.3211
<BOS> Believe her to be deceived by all means .    27.9013
<BOS> After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . "    24.1982
<BOS> Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr . Darcy looked up .    23.6855
<BOS> His doing so drew her notice .    56.5335
<BOS> The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; Jane certainly could not come back .    50.9061
<BOS> After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .    55.3432
<BOS> " Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you .    22.9285
<BOS> I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted .    32.3963
<BOS> She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to Mary at all .    22.0087
<BOS> " What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ?    18.6156
<BOS> Who are your uncles and aunts ?    51.4247
<BOS> As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .    66.8775
<BOS> Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs .    46.1916
<BOS> It is unaccountable !    11.2619
<BOS> " Lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ?    11.3436
<BOS> You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty .    32.4955
<BOS> They called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .    43.4945
<BOS> " We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said Jane : " I hope and trust they will yet be happy .    28.4390
<BOS> I have not the smallest hope .    11.6093
<BOS> The day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .    24.5033
<BOS> But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .    53.6042
<BOS> In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .    42.1800
<BOS> The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl . - - Oh !    30.2321
<BOS> Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom - - provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .    37.6363
<BOS> The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news .    38.1479
<BOS> He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .    33.6645
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . "    19.7214
<BOS> " My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me .    29.1553
<BOS> Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .    27.0978
<BOS> My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him .    21.0044
<BOS> I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . "    25.6919
<BOS> He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . "    23.3374
<BOS> She is quite a little creature .    20.1391
<BOS> " I do not get on at all .    12.7412
<BOS> the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself - - from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .    40.2481
<BOS> Kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .    48.7475
<BOS> Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , th October .    96.1764
<BOS> Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr . and Mrs . Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs . Jenkinson to make up her party .    21.1878
<BOS> About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .    37.7926
<BOS> If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark .    37.3920
<BOS> She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ; gone to stay .    55.2302
<BOS> Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs . Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected .    37.3015
<BOS> A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self - denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .    46.0069
<BOS> certainly , " said Elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . "    52.1795
<BOS> But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .    21.1401
<BOS> " I cannot believe it .    7.5752
<BOS> " Come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared .    27.0160
<BOS> " But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .    34.2556
<BOS> In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam .    57.7396
<BOS> She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself .    38.0269
<BOS> But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . "    25.4244
<BOS> " I am astonished , " said Miss Bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books . - - What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr .    20.4284
<BOS> " I shall be very fit to see Jane - - which is all I want . "    20.7581
<BOS> It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr . Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her .    14.6975
<BOS> " May I ask to what these questions tend ? "    27.0533
<BOS> " And this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection !    19.8850
<BOS> " I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .    23.2617
<BOS> Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .    35.8247
<BOS> They repulsed every attempt of Mrs . Bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr . Collins , who was complimenting Mr . Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests .    22.3352
<BOS> She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself .    51.1617
<BOS> It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .    18.6409
<BOS> But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most .    43.2795
<BOS> " We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . "    17.1144
<BOS> I expected you to stay two months .    56.0533
<BOS> In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .    32.9928
<BOS> " Oh , Lizzy !    8.5703
<BOS> my uncle ! "    17.8744
<BOS> " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must disarm reproof . "    10.2320
<BOS> Thank Heaven !    26.0103
<BOS> " I found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr . Darcy ; - - that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . "    26.5865
<BOS> " I am trying to make it out . "    8.7789
<BOS> Not these two or three years perhaps . "    28.4373
<BOS> The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed - rooms , were all that remained to be shewn .    27.6177
<BOS> It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .    26.6225
<BOS> " Did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ?    19.9006
<BOS> Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .    28.2174
<BOS> who attended to you ?    57.6640
<BOS> But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . "    52.3669
<BOS> " Very much . "    10.5823
<BOS> Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia .    28.5677
<BOS> It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night . "    17.7552
<BOS> He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St . James's , with very decent composure .    28.2141
<BOS> She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .    35.3553
<BOS> " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth .    14.5038
<BOS> I do not trust my own partiality .    18.0946
<BOS> She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs .    24.9776
<BOS> Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . "    18.3820
<BOS> The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! "    53.9578
<BOS> In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .    17.2225
<BOS> When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . "    20.4928
<BOS> Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .    25.4894
<BOS> It is useless to talk of it . "    15.5651
<BOS> A great deal more passed at the other table .    21.2088
<BOS> Mr . Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Mr . Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .    27.3463
<BOS> Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation .    47.8746
<BOS> What say you , Mary ?    53.9036
<BOS> My mind was more agreeably engaged .    28.4242
<BOS> We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . "    35.4325
<BOS> " La ! "    8.4301
<BOS> GARDINER . "    7.5923
<BOS> Occupied in observing Mr . Bingley's attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .    24.1995
<BOS> But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it .    13.7177
<BOS> If there were but such another man for you ! "    81.1647
<BOS> Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth .    40.1979
<BOS> For , though your accusations were ill - founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .    41.2373
<BOS> They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .    35.0612
<BOS> Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .    49.2710
<BOS> She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips's .    36.5476
<BOS> " That is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .    23.1885
<BOS> " She is my youngest girl but one .    27.7157
<BOS> " And they are really to be married ! "    12.9103
<BOS> Letters of business too !    86.3937
<BOS> She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .    19.7050
<BOS> I am not qualified to form one .    16.9865
<BOS> Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them .    42.0771
<BOS> It adds even another motive .    152.9176
<BOS> His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .    48.1634
<BOS> You see on what a footing we are .    75.9059
<BOS> I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . "    23.8269
<BOS> Not handsome enough to dance with !    53.4388
<BOS> " I should never have said Mrs . Collins was settled near her family . "    16.4262
<BOS> " I know not , Miss Elizabeth , " said he , " whether Mrs . Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .    20.9816
<BOS> " Do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain .    24.4117
<BOS> " What do you mean ? "    4.7804
<BOS> But your family owe me nothing .    36.2306
<BOS> On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .    25.3914
<BOS> She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .    30.0170
<BOS> Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .    31.3676
<BOS> He added , that Mr . Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon .    22.0094
<BOS> is not this an agreeable surprise ? "    85.7394
<BOS> He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . "    17.9548
<BOS> Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast - room .    15.2587
<BOS> The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .    25.1306
<BOS> But it is all , all too late now . "    34.0777
<BOS> Nobody wants him to come .    38.8385
<BOS> Mr . Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .    25.9639
<BOS> Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor . "    20.4753
<BOS> Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . "    24.4920
<BOS> Miss Lucas is married and settled .    51.4918
<BOS> Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano - forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .    15.9472
<BOS> Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .    23.6739
<BOS> She performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but Mrs . Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .    33.3738
<BOS> " I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .    27.0023
<BOS> she cried : " This is delightful indeed ! - - She will be married ! - - I shall see her again ! - - She will be married at sixteen ! - - My good , kind brother ! - - I knew how it would be - - I knew he would manage every thing .    24.0631
<BOS> There can be no occasion for your going so soon .    22.8622
<BOS> The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .    31.3941
<BOS> " We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! - - How much I shall have to tell ! "    36.4228
<BOS> My dear , dear Lydia ! - - How merry we shall be together when we meet ! "    21.4129
<BOS> They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .    36.0235
<BOS> Every thing nourishes what is strong already .    64.0858
<BOS> " I never can be thankful , Mr . Bennet , for any thing about the entail .    13.5631
<BOS> " I do not blame Jane , " she continued , " for Jane would have got Mr . Bingley , if she could .    16.5306
<BOS> He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Mr . Collins's letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go - - saying , as she quitted the room , " If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . "    33.5670
<BOS> " To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . "    43.5625
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> " What could he mean ?    20.4453
<BOS> With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? "    56.1547
<BOS> Darcy ? "    9.4573
<BOS> Allowing for the common demands of the game , Mr . Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr . Darcy .    22.8011
<BOS> In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name ; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .    31.5067
<BOS> He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .    33.6734
<BOS> Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . "    30.8372
<BOS> It must be his own doing . - - He is his own master .    18.0866
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .    37.7861
<BOS> As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .    32.3076
<BOS> You mentioned two instances .    69.8568
<BOS> " Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . "    13.4812
<BOS> " Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? "    32.5268
<BOS> " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .    37.5220
<BOS> " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .    33.2087
<BOS> I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good .    59.8094
<BOS> Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure .    32.1329
<BOS> " Obstinate , headstrong girl !    25.8735
<BOS> Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .    26.2709
<BOS> The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr . Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .    48.2755
<BOS> " I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation .    30.1799
<BOS> I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! "    42.9700
<BOS> Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .    23.4366
<BOS> Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive .    38.4184
<BOS> What shall we do with him ?    32.6675
<BOS> only think !    603.2377
<BOS> She dared not relate the other half of Mr . Darcy's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .    23.8153
<BOS> It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .    33.0629
<BOS> Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .    24.9667
<BOS> He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before .    27.1196
<BOS> His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . Darcy's sister , as , by Wickham's account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .    37.4966
<BOS> And when you have given your ball , " she added , " I shall insist on their giving one also .    29.4491
<BOS> I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . "    32.7881
<BOS> The first week of their return was soon gone .    28.7739
<BOS> Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly . "    33.0083
<BOS> He studies too much for words of four syllables . - - Do not you , Darcy ? "    32.8832
<BOS> They crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered it .    48.8641
<BOS> " You forget that I have made no answer .    11.4175
<BOS> You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did .    33.9682
<BOS> Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? "    43.2252
<BOS> She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .    42.2946
<BOS> Only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time .    25.4315
<BOS> Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . "    36.7813
<BOS> With a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations .    30.3665
<BOS> If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh .    23.6675
<BOS> I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . "    25.3158
<BOS> The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you .    25.5871
<BOS> The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .    29.8313
<BOS> I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . "    18.3628
<BOS> Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very innocently said , " What is the matter mamma ?    37.5927
<BOS> " Yes , Ma'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him - - just as affable to the poor . "    22.5428
<BOS> " Aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and Mrs . Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . "    16.5514
<BOS> She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother . - - Your's , & c . " E .    15.2522
<BOS> Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then was .    29.5934
<BOS> You are not going to be Missish , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .    22.7974
<BOS> Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano - forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance .    37.9472
<BOS> When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn .    18.4708
<BOS> Charlotte says , she hardly ever does .    73.4996
<BOS> Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .    38.1240
<BOS> She shared in their attendance on Mrs . Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .    19.6154
<BOS> Astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .    43.9072
<BOS> And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock .    22.5195
<BOS> But are you pleased , Jane ?    45.1635
<BOS> " Already arisen ! "    25.6931
<BOS> Though her manner varied however , her determination never did .    88.3792
<BOS> Elizabeth privately added , " And how much I shall have to conceal . "    20.2406
<BOS> cried he .    27.8941
<BOS> " Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .    16.3988
<BOS> " Let me be rightly understood .    34.4803
<BOS> I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "    20.0637
<BOS> She practises very constantly . "    28.8490
<BOS> She was gone directly .    22.2501
<BOS> " I never heard any thing so abominable .    13.4714
<BOS> It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .    21.4349
<BOS> Mr . Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , - - " This walk is not wide enough for our party .    32.1621
<BOS> Catherine , weak - spirited , irritable , and completely under Lydia's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self - willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .    44.0565
<BOS> Accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer .    32.9227
<BOS> You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas .    36.2557
<BOS> " She had better have stayed at home , " cried Elizabeth ; " perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one's neighbours .    35.4639
<BOS> I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .    30.5711
<BOS> Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . - - You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . "    22.0849
<BOS> Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .    36.6709
<BOS> The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her .    18.2585
<BOS> Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .    31.0851
<BOS> She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns .    33.1887
<BOS> As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half - finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Mr . Darcy , and Mr . Darcy only , entered the room .    32.3225
<BOS> Darcy . "    8.5963
<BOS> Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ?    54.4029
<BOS> " Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . "    29.8876
<BOS> Let me mend it for you .    18.9226
<BOS> There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .    22.9653
<BOS> Elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion .    25.2505
<BOS> By you , I was properly humbled .    48.1573
<BOS> She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr . Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle - piece .    28.7095
<BOS> At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .    24.0355
<BOS> That is all settled . "    15.3900
<BOS> He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .    26.6963
<BOS> I cannot quite agree with you there .    31.7204
<BOS> You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . "    33.9608
<BOS> Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr . Darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .    24.2267
<BOS> do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?    41.3029
<BOS> She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .    24.1976
<BOS> They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .    39.0880
<BOS> " You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr .    13.6871
<BOS> I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you .    16.9431
<BOS> If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .    60.7265
<BOS> From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl .    30.2309
<BOS> He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .    29.2782
<BOS> * * * * * The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased Mrs . Bennet's curiosity ; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject .    21.4833
<BOS> They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . "    28.9598
<BOS> said Elizabeth , " but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . "    16.2887
<BOS> " I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . "    29.7283
<BOS> " I assure you , Madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice .    9.0792
<BOS> Darcy made no answer .    7.1547
<BOS> But on returning to the drawing - room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .    18.1721
<BOS> " The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . "    41.9953
<BOS> The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball - - and at this ball , what do you think he did ?    29.8412
<BOS> replied Kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .    69.5246
<BOS> dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .    27.5419
<BOS> Elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr . Darcy , and reading in her neighbours ' looks their equal amazement in beholding it .    33.7384
<BOS> What could your ladyship propose by it ? "    37.0250
<BOS> " Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer .    24.4569
<BOS> There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . "    23.8048
<BOS> " You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound .    26.7417
<BOS> His apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .    39.0135
<BOS> I am so happy .    14.0378
<BOS> It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .    54.6399
<BOS> The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .    24.7867
<BOS> But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments .    29.5112
<BOS> that he should have been in love with her for so many months !    23.5857
<BOS> Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd !    45.7288
<BOS> " But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . "    20.2710
<BOS> Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way .    44.4740
<BOS> He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . "    26.2704
<BOS> About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged .    33.2611
<BOS> exclaimed Elizabeth , " you are too good .    20.9950
<BOS> " I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . "    16.3666
<BOS> Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! - - I never heard of such a thing .    26.2478
<BOS> It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say nothing of that .    26.6089
<BOS> She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . "    36.3483
<BOS> She answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .    32.1482
<BOS> Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .    20.7180
<BOS> Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .    42.8763
<BOS> Elizabeth could bear it no longer .    21.9476
<BOS> I am glad he dines here on Tuesday .    22.6296
<BOS> And , above all things , keep Mr . Bennet from fighting .    49.9534
<BOS> She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs . Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr . Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy .    23.3990
<BOS> cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared .    19.6314
<BOS> " She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property . "    31.4233
<BOS> This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .    50.7045
<BOS> She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .    21.6924
<BOS> The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid .    45.1323
<BOS> " Another time , Lizzy , " said her mother , " I would not dance with him , if I were you . "    10.9391
<BOS> Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it .    38.5487
<BOS> But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt .    27.9881
<BOS> Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .    24.6558
<BOS> My father bears it better .    32.3733
<BOS> Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . "    42.0292
<BOS> But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .    36.7547
<BOS> " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . "    42.3043
<BOS> At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion .    58.3391
<BOS> His daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .    40.6024
<BOS> Oh , that I knew how it was ! "    23.3138
<BOS> " No governess !    15.0618
<BOS> No , no - - I feel he may defy us there .    35.0375
<BOS> " Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .    37.6762
<BOS> No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame .    26.1002
<BOS> Since the - - - - shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .    31.3036
<BOS> But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .    43.5762
<BOS> " You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . "    20.6601
<BOS> But that is not the case here .    22.7146
<BOS> It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .    20.1328
<BOS> She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .    39.5906
<BOS> They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother's tea .    17.4801
<BOS> I hardly know how Mr . Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . "    28.7725
<BOS> Will you come and see me ? "    22.4092
<BOS> " Oh , yes .    9.4733
<BOS> " Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ?    40.5542
<BOS> " He is certainly a good brother , " said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .    11.5783
<BOS> Elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .    31.1435
<BOS> A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it - - or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing .    41.3273
<BOS> Oh , Lord !    33.6850
<BOS> " Certainly not ; at first .    47.5108
<BOS> She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .    23.8586
<BOS> Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? "    36.1142
<BOS> Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life .    30.0439
<BOS> " Not as you represent it .    20.9804
<BOS> " No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose .    10.8028
<BOS> This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .    58.5187
<BOS> She held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .    33.9538
<BOS> " My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour .    21.8468
<BOS> " Well , then , you need not be under any alarm .    19.5948
<BOS> Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene .    25.8109
<BOS> My temper would perhaps be called resentful . - - My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . "    40.2049
<BOS> " Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ?    20.9026
<BOS> " How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains !    68.6739
<BOS> Darcy ? "    9.4573
<BOS> She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne's .    22.6320
<BOS> He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . "    21.7422
<BOS> Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly .    46.0866
<BOS> " It is amazing to me , " said Bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . "    16.8965
<BOS> Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that I despair .    27.9197
<BOS> When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . "    20.8071
<BOS> If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up . "    18.4506
<BOS> It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . "    32.8790
<BOS> He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite congratulation ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation .    31.7831
<BOS> " I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! "    23.1106
<BOS> She was teazed by Mr . Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .    16.4027
<BOS> In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .    33.8051
<BOS> We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .    63.6672
<BOS> are quite well . "    23.3613
<BOS> They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .    32.1153
<BOS> Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .    36.9210
<BOS> Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged .    34.5843
<BOS> Thank God !    47.4336
<BOS> Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . - - But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .    48.9529
<BOS> Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .    23.6996
<BOS> Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .    18.7570
<BOS> " Her not objecting , does not justify him .    39.8986
<BOS> She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again .    31.9628
<BOS> " ' Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he .    16.2554
<BOS> Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys .    20.3963
<BOS> His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .    48.2414
<BOS> At present we have nothing to guide us .    27.0347
<BOS> In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned .    21.6287
<BOS> One morning , about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining - room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .    22.8237
<BOS> It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .    50.1063
<BOS> And she rose as she spoke .    28.2715
<BOS> Nothing could be more delightful !    30.6641
<BOS> I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . "    18.0217
<BOS> In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .    65.5214
<BOS> That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .    23.1640
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday .    22.5739
<BOS> But perhaps Mr . Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . "    22.7751
<BOS> Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .    33.1248
<BOS> Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .    35.0820
<BOS> She had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means .    27.5618
<BOS> He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . "    25.4401
<BOS> It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .    30.9541
<BOS> He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do .    24.3558
<BOS> And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? "    33.6002
<BOS> She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs . Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family .    30.4621
<BOS> Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .    30.1090
<BOS> " If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . "    26.9474
<BOS> " You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged .    31.5931
<BOS> With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !    48.3697
<BOS> But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is .    34.1347
<BOS> My feelings will not be repressed .    18.5657
<BOS> Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? "    89.6413
<BOS> Elizabeth was forced to go .    14.7123
<BOS> You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice .    41.9244
<BOS> " Well , Lizzy , " said Mrs . Bennet one day , " what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane's ?    18.1200
<BOS> " She is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . "    15.8749
<BOS> In the former were many good paintings ; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .    38.4216
<BOS> " Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .    33.5582
<BOS> Darcy ? "    9.4573
<BOS> But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .    28.2740
<BOS> Unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only child ) I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .    58.2387
<BOS> Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .    105.8456
<BOS> I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .    48.9025
<BOS> We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .    24.9349
<BOS> " And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress !    20.9378
<BOS> Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! "    49.7720
<BOS> He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again .    11.0613
<BOS> Jane was beyond competition her favourite child .    44.5386
<BOS> how rich and how great you will be !    40.1375
<BOS> Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above - mentioned ; and while Mr . Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person , behaviour , and dress .    46.2747
<BOS> She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !    39.5375
<BOS> It would have suited me in every respect . "    17.6693
<BOS> But he is an ugly fellow !    16.2268
<BOS> The path just admitted three .    137.3767
<BOS> Mr . Darcy may hug himself . "    10.2308
<BOS> But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's .    34.4891
<BOS> But now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground .    37.8319
<BOS> From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent .    50.8359
<BOS> He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us .    33.5465
<BOS> " My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? "    19.1092
<BOS> It is highly improper .    20.4298
<BOS> Mr . Hurst looked at her with astonishment .    10.8609
<BOS> The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him .    31.4032
<BOS> " Most willingly . "    22.1403
<BOS> " Well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " What say you to the day ?    17.0418
<BOS> " It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . "    29.2018
<BOS> Pray read on . "    38.6200
<BOS> " Care of him ! - - Yes , I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care .    45.5902
<BOS> Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .    28.5295
<BOS> Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness .    14.3253
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " Well , Jane , who is it from ?    18.8954
<BOS> I have not a doubt of your doing very well together .    22.4354
<BOS> In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her .    46.6888
<BOS> She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .    37.2244
<BOS> Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair . "    130.4183
<BOS> I thought I should have died .    26.8372
<BOS> Pray write instantly , and let me understand it - - unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . "    31.6090
<BOS> Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; - - but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .    32.8847
<BOS> Mr . Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .    39.7989
<BOS> " We have heard only once .    23.4442
<BOS> " Perhaps , " said Darcy , " I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . "    19.7410
<BOS> Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .    34.3897
<BOS> " She is so fond of Mrs . Forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away !    13.8320
<BOS> His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr . Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .    37.7450
<BOS> She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .    26.9792
<BOS> Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . "    27.6047
<BOS> you do not know what I suffer . "    12.5813
<BOS> Your idea of the ponies is delightful .    25.5550
<BOS> I only hope they may have half my good luck .    44.5854
<BOS> They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .    24.0939
<BOS> If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once .    37.1407
<BOS> But it was her business to be satisfied - - and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .    34.5905
<BOS> " It is not Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . "    9.4130
<BOS> She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . "    18.5684
<BOS> They met several times , for there was much to be discussed .    23.3615
<BOS> It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half - hour's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .    65.8763
<BOS> - - She could have added , " A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " - - but she contented herself with " And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! "    54.7502
<BOS> " I dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . "    11.6969
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> Mr . Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my love .    31.7643
<BOS> Mr . Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs . Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .    25.3026
<BOS> But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless .    37.6337
<BOS> I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . "    25.5081
<BOS> He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr . Darcy had been staying there .    43.3934
<BOS> " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these .    14.4461
<BOS> They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it . "    26.3526
<BOS> Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .    41.8652
<BOS> " But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . "    27.9352
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast .    30.4802
<BOS> They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .    26.0082
<BOS> I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . "    25.7153
<BOS> I came to try you .    33.8779
<BOS> Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth .    28.8876
<BOS> I have no such injuries to resent .    19.5332
<BOS> Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .    35.3363
<BOS> Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter .    39.1215
<BOS> Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , " Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .    26.9138
<BOS> " Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself .    10.1513
<BOS> You alluded to something else .    40.1833
<BOS> " When I consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that I might have prevented it ! - - I who knew what he was .    23.4619
<BOS> " An excellent consolation in its way , " said Elizabeth , " but it will not do for us .    11.8532
<BOS> But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr . Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr . Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . "    34.3101
<BOS> By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration .    44.5977
<BOS> " It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said Bingley .    26.4638
<BOS> She declared her resolution .    30.0408
<BOS> " I began to be afraid you would never come back again .    22.7489
<BOS> " You mistake me , my dear .    13.0534
<BOS> Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .    64.3287
<BOS> " I never saw a more promising inclination .    17.3420
<BOS> ' Ah !    29.6518
<BOS> Let me hear from you very soon .    33.6220
<BOS> She dared not even mention that gentleman .    34.8364
<BOS> But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .    19.9862
<BOS> " I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . "    15.0349
<BOS> She was overpowered by shame and vexation .    9.9926
<BOS> Adieu to disappointment and spleen .    52.8407
<BOS> You know not what you are about . "    11.3943
<BOS> And to be kept back on such a motive ! - - I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . "    29.2574
<BOS> My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her .    32.4655
<BOS> With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .    19.3299
<BOS> She blushed , and Jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .    27.0111
<BOS> " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own .    26.6801
<BOS> To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .    38.6480
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .    27.9169
<BOS> It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .    55.1418
<BOS> And poor Mr . Darcy !    19.1487
<BOS> It is impossible that he should still love me . "    21.3993
<BOS> I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .    16.1021
<BOS> Bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .    28.0094
<BOS> But you do not know all .    12.1721
<BOS> " Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr . Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ?    36.2179
<BOS> " Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . "    14.6793
<BOS> Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs . Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast - room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .    35.9026
<BOS> It is because he will not give himself the trouble . "    20.9291
<BOS> " Mr .    16.4226
<BOS> There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name .    33.1366
<BOS> Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women .    57.4694
<BOS> " Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , " said Elizabeth .    18.7928
<BOS> My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! "    30.4354
<BOS> I shall never forget her appearance this morning .    25.5386
<BOS> The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .    35.2136
<BOS> His words seemed to imply it .    22.1243
<BOS> " He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied Elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . "    19.4229
<BOS> Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased .    39.0287
<BOS> " Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? "    26.4403
<BOS> " Ah ! "    6.6737
<BOS> " Do let us have a little music , " - - cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . - - " Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr .    23.8805
<BOS> After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " It is your turn to say something now , Mr .    52.8657
<BOS> I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . "    22.4886
<BOS> " You are over scrupulous surely .    17.8022
<BOS> " What do you think ?    10.5188
<BOS> Girls , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ?    32.7151
<BOS> From their infancy , they have been intended for each other .    27.4027
<BOS> said Mr . Gardiner .    11.8869
<BOS> But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .    14.1018
<BOS> He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .    42.1781
<BOS> There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .    30.0550
<BOS> A few weeks , he believed .    29.8233
<BOS> " Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth .    20.5017
<BOS> Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .    26.0156
<BOS> " And that , " said Mrs . Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master - - and very like him .    24.0131
<BOS> " It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's . "    19.2230
<BOS> Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr . Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr . Bingley's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance .    23.5944
<BOS> " If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you .    18.8959
<BOS> I cannot do justice to his kindness .    25.2766
<BOS> Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not .    32.1105
<BOS> It is almost past belief .    48.8125
<BOS> If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before - hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .    36.3316
<BOS> I am only ashamed of his asking so little . "    18.0445
<BOS> As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr . Bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .    43.4737
<BOS> Did he know of their intending to go off ?    42.7056
<BOS> Kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .    40.9508
<BOS> Not that I am afraid of myself , but I dread other people's remarks . "    18.8105
<BOS> " Now I have got some news for you , " said Lydia , as they sat down to table .    14.3616
<BOS> He still loves me , and we are engaged . "    16.4772
<BOS> Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .    33.1967
<BOS> Bingley is most unaffectedly modest .    40.8101
<BOS> No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .    86.1054
<BOS> In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . "    21.6101
<BOS> Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .    25.6261
<BOS> " You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin .    30.7742
<BOS> How much you must have gone through ! "    33.6277
<BOS> To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs . Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .    31.6329
<BOS> " I must not decide on my own performance . "    12.0940
<BOS> The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above .    39.7977
<BOS> " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently .    19.1341
<BOS> " Yes , she called yesterday with her father .    21.1132
<BOS> " What , none of you ? "    15.7610
<BOS> The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .    29.5617
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> " Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . "    14.8291
<BOS> But it is of small importance . "    19.4316
<BOS> Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same .    51.3281
<BOS> I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .    51.2035
<BOS> Mr . Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .    33.2126
<BOS> What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?    46.5380
<BOS> I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .    42.5873
<BOS> She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained .    39.1980
<BOS> There is one point , on which I want your advice .    29.1119
<BOS> " She did indeed , Louisa .    34.4389
<BOS> " Yes , or I will never see her again . "    8.3156
<BOS> " She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . "    14.2789
<BOS> Elizabeth's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .    51.7699
<BOS> Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy's looks and behaviour .    26.3778
<BOS> " I did not know that you intended to walk , " said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .    15.8589
<BOS> Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .    17.5997
<BOS> She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham .    32.6394
<BOS> They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .    46.3435
<BOS> " Yes , all of them , I think .    19.8451
<BOS> But now it comes out . "    25.2339
<BOS> " Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's . "    26.1861
<BOS> Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?    30.5337
<BOS> Calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly .    53.2657
<BOS> shocking ! "    38.0385
<BOS> But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . "    31.4243
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet was really in a most pitiable state .    12.7552
<BOS> She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .    32.5565
<BOS> Conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .    24.5689
<BOS> " It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire .    14.8824
<BOS> But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill - judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .    41.7151
<BOS> As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . "    35.5910
<BOS> Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .    77.4636
<BOS> After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .    46.0825
<BOS> Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .    31.9529
<BOS> She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected - - " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . "    27.5269
<BOS> And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . "    35.5335
<BOS> It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you .    27.5227
<BOS> It soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family ; - - and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before .    32.1906
<BOS> Let me do it without farther loss of time .    40.5021
<BOS> Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr . Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .    27.4175
<BOS> Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .    38.8709
<BOS> pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen !    18.4989
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could .    16.4668
<BOS> She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater - - what shall I call it ?    28.9527
<BOS> His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .    32.0887
<BOS> We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome .    59.8920
<BOS> " I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . - - We may compare our different opinions . "    28.1633
<BOS> repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .    44.2792
<BOS> Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections .    49.5659
<BOS> But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant .    22.9490
<BOS> He had been some time with Mr . Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .    25.2062
<BOS> " I comfort myself with thinking , " replied Jane , " that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .    16.8588
<BOS> It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour .    32.0966
<BOS> She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley .    23.5173
<BOS> Her own thoughts were employing her .    23.7096
<BOS> " My dear , dear Lydia ! "    6.7784
<BOS> Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .    71.3647
<BOS> I will speak to her about it myself directly .    37.8556
<BOS> " If !    18.5520
<BOS> It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr . Darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .    37.5444
<BOS> Secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly - - which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness .    34.2015
<BOS> Their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme .    35.8198
<BOS> But we are all liable to error .    23.1318
<BOS> " He is also handsome , " replied Elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can .    21.6511
<BOS> cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .    14.5568
<BOS> Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .    27.9284
<BOS> There was another reason too for her opposition .    61.7269
<BOS> Let her go then .    98.4946
<BOS> " I am sorry it went off .    13.1848
<BOS> My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ; - - most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education .    30.9624
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> " In point of composition , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem defective .    19.6069
<BOS> A clear ten thousand per annum .    62.7575
<BOS> Lord !    24.2487
<BOS> You blamed me for coming ? "    23.4160
<BOS> But perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .    41.3816
<BOS> " Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! "    31.5289
<BOS> When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful .    48.2620
<BOS> " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . "    28.2436
<BOS> She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .    40.6082
<BOS> " There is nothing the matter with me .    13.8998
<BOS> " But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham . "    20.6568
<BOS> I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .    30.3746
<BOS> I always said it must be so , at last .    35.0994
<BOS> " And we mean to treat you all , " added Lydia ; " but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . "    26.9084
<BOS> Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Mr . Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . "    36.5419
<BOS> " Which do you mean ? "    7.7064
<BOS> But I knew not - - I was afraid of doing too much .    14.7410
<BOS> said Elizabeth .    9.5990
<BOS> I want to talk very seriously .    31.8557
<BOS> " How despicably have I acted ! "    30.7652
<BOS> The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . "    33.0325
<BOS> " I have heard much of your master's fine person , " said Mrs . Gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face .    19.4550
<BOS> Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr . Darcy's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr . Darcy in a most infamous manner .    33.9674
<BOS> " I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .    23.8270
<BOS> She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , " Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , " took her out of the room .    30.7443
<BOS> She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .    26.4202
<BOS> I shall now know how to act .    31.6522
<BOS> the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . "    45.8966
<BOS> The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr . Bingley from your sister , - - and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of Mr .    26.8748
<BOS> how he must have felt it ! "    27.3708
<BOS> Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .    66.7690
<BOS> A thousand things may arise in six months ! "    40.5096
<BOS> For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey .    30.9247
<BOS> The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .    35.5859
<BOS> Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home .    24.9121
<BOS> why did she come ?    52.2615
<BOS> " Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . "    37.7488
<BOS> " In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , " said Bingley ; " and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . "    18.4940
<BOS> He could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .    28.6013
<BOS> The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs . Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family .    33.1927
<BOS> Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .    39.0296
<BOS> Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .    49.9958
<BOS> " Oh , Jane , take care . "    20.6715
<BOS> It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage .    20.1524
<BOS> Brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton . "    37.2966
<BOS> I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . "    23.8917
<BOS> Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world .    38.6815
<BOS> " Are they indeed ? "    30.2524
<BOS> I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone . "    27.0651
<BOS> " Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's . "    28.6196
<BOS> " Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .    18.7651
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .    58.5387
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr . Darcy by character perfectly well .    26.9624
<BOS> Not one party , or scheme , or any thing .    27.9742
<BOS> Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the Boulanger - - - - " " If he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much !    27.1451
<BOS> " You began the evening well , Charlotte , " said Mrs . Bennet with civil self - command to Miss Lucas .    26.1557
<BOS> It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .    35.6816
<BOS> Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .    67.8543
<BOS> It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way .    26.0058
<BOS> While these newly - born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing .    44.2572
<BOS> Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room .    23.8678
<BOS> Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . "    35.9218
<BOS> While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them .    31.3840
<BOS> " I have said no such thing .    12.9161
<BOS> He did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September , than any body else in the country .    16.8686
<BOS> " I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled .    26.0924
<BOS> " Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . "    30.4682
<BOS> The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .    17.6066
<BOS> In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .    26.7252
<BOS> Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .    42.2045
<BOS> If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs . Long .    19.6045
<BOS> " Well , so much the better .    9.9115
<BOS> Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? "    27.6221
<BOS> Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .    20.9105
<BOS> It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .    19.7613
<BOS> I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . "    25.8403
<BOS> And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .    44.6836
<BOS> This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .    34.4703
<BOS> " Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .    24.7026
<BOS> " I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women .    57.7567
<BOS> Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . "    29.2902
<BOS> The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . "    25.9637
<BOS> " Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? "    32.9461
<BOS> I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .    11.8635
<BOS> Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars .    31.1051
<BOS> I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night .    24.8392
<BOS> I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .    28.5184
<BOS> When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .    47.4847
<BOS> " Well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy .    10.9042
<BOS> " And I certainly never shall give it .    16.4268
<BOS> She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .    41.6467
<BOS> As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship ! - - How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! - - How much of good or evil must be done by him !    28.5509
<BOS> Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria .    20.3648
<BOS> His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . "    42.9288
<BOS> " Do you prefer reading to cards ? "    26.2902
<BOS> Seriously , I would have you be on your guard .    29.1631
<BOS> I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . "    29.4530
<BOS> " That is very true , " replied Elizabeth , " and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . "    15.5293
<BOS> A younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . "    19.4962
<BOS> But against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .    29.5223
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; Mrs . Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .    34.9262
<BOS> I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun . "    28.6728
<BOS> With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .    41.0304
<BOS> Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . "    24.6476
<BOS> " This account then is what he has received from Mr . Darcy .    25.4658
<BOS> I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . "    17.0657
<BOS> At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . "    42.9301
<BOS> But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . "    28.2075
<BOS> In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs . Philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .    30.3644
<BOS> On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . "    37.2473
<BOS> I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them .    36.5651
<BOS> It settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .    27.4651
<BOS> Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .    19.8092
<BOS> He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .    20.1554
<BOS> I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement .    24.3192
<BOS> They will never be distressed for money .    26.7022
<BOS> Darcy ! - - My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to forfeit it .    31.2896
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure .    20.0691
<BOS> Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ?    27.5481
<BOS> said Mrs . Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .    25.0460
<BOS> single , my dear , to be sure !    32.1345
<BOS> " Very well .    13.4336
<BOS> " I am , dear Sir , & c . & c . " Mr . Gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send .    15.3177
<BOS> I quite detest the man . "    31.5617
<BOS> " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . "    26.8923
<BOS> How was that possible ?    71.5381
<BOS> We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , - - only think what fun !    72.4017
<BOS> Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .    40.5865
<BOS> With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected .    42.1968
<BOS> He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr . Darcy .    31.4162
<BOS> But if I go on , I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem .    29.5600
<BOS> She comes to us to - day .    28.6941
<BOS> Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept .    38.2175
<BOS> In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .    49.9543
<BOS> " Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . "    25.6133
<BOS> When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so .    41.5353
<BOS> But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs . Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise . "    28.3631
<BOS> My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister's partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart .    49.8725
<BOS> Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . "    23.3285
<BOS> He has heartily forgiven me now . "    34.0278
<BOS> I will read it to you - - " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .    34.2650
<BOS> " I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before .    27.4192
<BOS> When the ladies returned to the drawing - room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted .    30.5672
<BOS> Excuse me - - for I must speak plainly .    41.8542
<BOS> " This fine account of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . "    24.3713
<BOS> Miss Bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room .    33.7891
<BOS> " Lady Catherine de Bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living .    15.3046
<BOS> It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining .    20.4612
<BOS> It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .    19.9660
<BOS> Mr . Wickham began the subject himself .    17.5645
<BOS> " No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . - - I desire you will stay where you are . "    27.7175
<BOS> She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness . - - Mr .    27.2723
<BOS> " Did Charlotte dine with you ? "    22.8632
<BOS> The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions .    32.1196
<BOS> She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . "    16.9862
<BOS> Unfeeling , selfish girl !    55.4516
<BOS> Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ?    67.5267
<BOS> She had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .    28.4747
<BOS> After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F . came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through .    40.3325
<BOS> His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her - - their opinion of every body - - would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .    43.9037
<BOS> She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false !    35.9593
<BOS> He was silent .    14.7487
<BOS> I congratulate her .    16.3015
<BOS> Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .    23.9448
<BOS> " Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks .    12.0450
<BOS> But as it is - - you must not let your fancy run away with you .    36.3350
<BOS> He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " That will do extremely well , child .    36.7418
<BOS> His sense of her inferiority - - of its being a degradation - - of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit .    42.1525
<BOS> Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill .    35.7863
<BOS> Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .    59.9034
<BOS> Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs . Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .    38.6324
<BOS> " I knew , " said he , " that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .    13.2894
<BOS> Her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines .    59.6146
<BOS> He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .    63.7396
<BOS> " On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago .    21.6029
<BOS> " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother - - " because he does not write with ease .    28.5274
<BOS> Mr . Bennet could not have chosen better .    11.2576
<BOS> After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .    33.2132
<BOS> " You are mistaken .    8.3942
<BOS> dear , yes ; - - but you must own she is very plain .    49.6411
<BOS> From herself to Jane - - from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr . Darcy's explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again .    39.6178
<BOS> Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes - - but by everybody else Mr . Darcy was condemned as the worst of men .    34.6897
<BOS> Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .    31.0141
<BOS> Mrs . Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .    30.0283
<BOS> Brother - in - law of Wickham !    93.4748
<BOS> Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed .    41.4283
<BOS> Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .    33.1548
<BOS> And when I returned home , the - - - - shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time .    20.5896
<BOS> If I have wounded your sister's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them . - - With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .    41.2628
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .    18.1884
<BOS> " Pride , " observed Mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing I believe .    35.0032
<BOS> Could she have seen half as much love in Mr . Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .    38.1328
<BOS> Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth .    48.4499
<BOS> " Insolent girl ! "    15.6532
<BOS> " Would Mr . Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? "    30.3889
<BOS> Well , he is a very undeserving young man - - and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .    27.1799
<BOS> They all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses .    20.2108
<BOS> And she was only sixteen last June .    37.1360
<BOS> " And that I suppose is one of your sisters . "    12.7700
<BOS> Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .    52.1385
<BOS> They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .    24.4713
<BOS> At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs . Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . "    19.5942
<BOS> She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of Mr . Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings .    29.7683
<BOS> She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .    32.4031
<BOS> You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these .    35.8057
<BOS> I have not been accustomed to such language as this .    21.4363
<BOS> As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . - - Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr . Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh .    33.7503
<BOS> She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse .    21.9589
<BOS> " There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .    34.6642
<BOS> Mr . Bingley arrived .    13.8811
<BOS> It was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long .    15.6751
<BOS> my dear , " continued Mrs . Bennet , " I am quite delighted with him .    8.4800
<BOS> Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .    22.7146
<BOS> " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . "    20.2583
<BOS> When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish .    49.4331
<BOS> It was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .    19.9403
<BOS> Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can , - - or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty runs away . "    34.1495
<BOS> She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height , or rather taller . "    39.0179
<BOS> Is not it so , Mrs .    41.3760
<BOS> The horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .    27.6740
<BOS> Yes , there was something in that ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . "    31.7464
<BOS> Yours ever , " CAROLINE BINGLEY . "    56.9507
<BOS> " Oh , yes ! - - he was to come there with Wickham , you know .    25.0895
<BOS> Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .    31.4858
<BOS> Kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy .    42.2799
<BOS> The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .    32.0428
<BOS> " And what arts did he use to separate them ? "    29.9051
<BOS> " If I were as rich as Mr . Darcy , " cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , " I should not care how proud I was .    26.1129
<BOS> But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . "    37.3192
<BOS> How can they suit each other ? - - Do you know Mr .    23.0983
<BOS> Teazing , teazing , man !    140.0411
<BOS> Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .    45.0549
<BOS> Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .    55.1711
<BOS> Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy .    24.6091
<BOS> " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . "    13.7972
<BOS> It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit .    33.1766
<BOS> One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . "    45.9322
<BOS> Mrs . Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight , when she should enter the room .    22.7412
<BOS> Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . - - Elizabeth was in agonies .    38.6513
<BOS> Mr . Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her .    35.6253
<BOS> She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley .    23.2691
<BOS> " But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for .    16.4675
<BOS> " My object then , " replied Darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .    32.9502
<BOS> The venison was roasted to a turn - - and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .    29.1308
<BOS> Each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr . Bingley's friend , without being heard by either of them .    24.6320
<BOS> Then turning to Mr . Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .    28.9329
<BOS> my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy !    11.5692
<BOS> It is nearly fifty miles . "    22.7009
<BOS> But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .    20.6478
<BOS> The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas !    25.9270
<BOS> Again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .    16.1509
<BOS> He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .    22.3523
<BOS> " I beg your pardon ; - - one knows exactly what to think . "    16.3824
<BOS> " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . "    22.5123
<BOS> Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs . Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .    24.4182
<BOS> To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle - piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .    26.5834
<BOS> She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self - conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .    34.2823
<BOS> She will not be able to help calling . "    18.2469
<BOS> Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .    34.9195
<BOS> And for this we are to be thankful .    31.8616
<BOS> How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . "    51.7409
<BOS> Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then .    51.3987
<BOS> We can all begin freely - - a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .    67.1236
<BOS> A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .    22.2097
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman - like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .    30.4871
<BOS> It was to be such a secret ! "    19.3333
<BOS> " It is from Miss Bingley , " said Jane , and then read it aloud .    14.2244
<BOS> Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "    25.7460
<BOS> where , where is my uncle ? "    58.1346
<BOS> I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . "    36.7415
<BOS> They were in - - - - street .    15.9140
<BOS> The loo table , however , did not appear .    19.5783
<BOS> Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .    23.2789
<BOS> " Poor Wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance !    27.0319
<BOS> She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . - - Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it .    31.6385
<BOS> He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday .    27.1686
<BOS> " You used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs . Hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . "    29.1384
<BOS> And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .    24.7382
<BOS> Oh , Lizzy !    20.4442
<BOS> Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .    53.3546
<BOS> Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr . Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr . Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it .    24.9451
<BOS> " You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner - - in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion .    29.7794
<BOS> To Mr . Darcy it was welcome intelligence - - Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough .    40.9545
<BOS> Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . "    28.7618
<BOS> When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .    21.6107
<BOS> Pemberley was now Georgiana's home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see .    43.9807
<BOS> " Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia's side , but nothing to give him any alarm .    36.9924
<BOS> " I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .    49.9564
<BOS> Ten thousand a year , and very likely more !    30.5267
<BOS> It was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from Jane .    20.9189
<BOS> Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane .    22.8104
<BOS> Sir William had been delighted with him .    12.7430
<BOS> I thought we never should have got into the coach .    25.4975
<BOS> It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel's family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best .    26.0717
<BOS> On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all .    43.4349
<BOS> " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet .    11.9104
<BOS> Darcy was fixed in astonishment .    49.4412
<BOS> Do not let us quarrel about the past .    27.4637
<BOS> Her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .    39.4996
<BOS> Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .    33.5026
<BOS> " My father and Maria are to come to me in March , " added Charlotte , " and I hope you will consent to be of the party .    17.4525
<BOS> " If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it . "    25.5941
<BOS> and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . "    28.4079
<BOS> If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him .    25.1248
<BOS> It is what every body says .    15.7360
<BOS> These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .    36.7185
<BOS> Darcy ! "    10.2942
<BOS> He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him .    36.6479
<BOS> " Dear madam , " cried Mrs . Hill , in great astonishment , " don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr . Gardiner ?    45.6736
<BOS> From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him .    43.2851
<BOS> There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .    27.2586
<BOS> But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr . Wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition .    37.9589
<BOS> Have you had any flirting ?    29.6307
<BOS> " My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners - - my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .    37.8774
<BOS> " We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .    33.4121
<BOS> Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .    30.2990
<BOS> In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were by no means over .    34.9882
<BOS> Poor Charlotte ! - - it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! - - But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .    34.1898
<BOS> She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .    28.4433
<BOS> " If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it would not make them one jot less agreeable . "    20.3375
<BOS> He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay .    41.0407
<BOS> She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .    23.5189
<BOS> " Lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . "    20.5941
<BOS> A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern .    38.4532
<BOS> His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her's lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .    31.6720
<BOS> But when she read , and re - read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .    40.8636
<BOS> " And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . "    22.8683
<BOS> " Elizabeth , you are not serious now . "    15.7388
<BOS> Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . "    57.1373
<BOS> " How could you begin ? "    13.5893
<BOS> Here again I shall give you pain - - to what degree you only can tell .    58.2631
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .    64.7321
<BOS> I am not equal to it .    9.2830
<BOS> In understanding Darcy was the superior .    45.7752
<BOS> said her mother .    15.9991
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .    30.3280
<BOS> The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr . Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .    38.7250
<BOS> " I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . "    30.8076
<BOS> " That is his notion of christian forgiveness !    27.6359
<BOS> There - - I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable .    38.6556
<BOS> We neither of us perform to strangers . "    41.9513
<BOS> " No , no .    24.4521
<BOS> From the entrance hall , of which Mr . Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti - chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs . Jenkinson were sitting . - - Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs . Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .    32.6919
<BOS> Your mother insists upon your accepting it .    42.9099
<BOS> Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs . Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .    38.6347
<BOS> If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . "    39.0309
<BOS> In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .    49.0230
<BOS> But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home .    37.5963
<BOS> But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money .    38.7986
<BOS> I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful . "    26.8374
<BOS> Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .    37.4316
<BOS> When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr . Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel .    28.6897
<BOS> Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs . Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .    38.3239
<BOS> Elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley .    40.2133
<BOS> " Nearly three weeks . "    18.4904
<BOS> " I can answer your question , " said Fitzwilliam , " without applying to him .    18.2644
<BOS> " When my eyes were opened to his real character . - - Oh !    18.9873
<BOS> Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs . Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet .    29.9000
<BOS> I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr .    38.3204
<BOS> Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked .    18.8660
<BOS> " It may perhaps be pleasant , " replied Charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded .    16.9318
<BOS> I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . - - These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . "    31.8861
<BOS> " You cannot be too much on your guard .    12.4496
<BOS> Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door - bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .    26.9181
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet said only , " Nonsense , nonsense ! "    18.0821
<BOS> We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home .    40.2237
<BOS> Mr . Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth - - and it was soon done - - done while Mrs . Bennet was stirring the fire .    25.7021
<BOS> Georgiana's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .    49.6364
<BOS> I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you !    32.4224
<BOS> Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . "    36.6558
<BOS> She enquired after his sister , but could do no more .    21.5438
<BOS> She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .    40.4157
<BOS> So much the better .    22.5258
<BOS> The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear - sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .    37.9801
<BOS> " I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? "    12.3829
<BOS> This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . "    28.6012
<BOS> Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name .    26.3885
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head .    29.6299
<BOS> I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . "    10.3896
<BOS> Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .    19.5181
<BOS> " It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . "    29.8297
<BOS> But does not Jane correspond with the sister ?    40.1804
<BOS> The possibility of meeting Mr . Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .    30.3025
<BOS> This was his plan of amends - - of atonement - - for inheriting their father's estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .    37.4690
<BOS> There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .    39.8614
<BOS> We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton .    31.6257
<BOS> " It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on .    25.8837
<BOS> I knew you would be wishing me joy . "    22.2824
<BOS> Hear me in silence .    27.9690
<BOS> I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .    48.8486
<BOS> What are men to rocks and mountains ?    71.8134
<BOS> It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .    40.5801
<BOS> You could scarcely escape discredit and misery .    73.9846
<BOS> As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .    44.9890
<BOS> " I have , Sir . "    11.5305
<BOS> When Mrs . Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .    38.9504
<BOS> " Both , " replied Elizabeth archly ; " for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . - - We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . "    26.9054
<BOS> Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .    47.3390
<BOS> It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard . "    26.4596
<BOS> You never see a fault in any body .    33.6123
<BOS> It is every way horrible ! "    19.7638
<BOS> My affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . "    33.4711
<BOS> She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation , and hurried her away to her room .    32.6587
<BOS> if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better .    43.2830
<BOS> The wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual .    30.7881
<BOS> There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him .    28.6071
<BOS> She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him .    26.7076
<BOS> The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay .    31.2555
<BOS> The strangeness of Mr . Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .    37.5248
<BOS> The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr .    26.5952
<BOS> If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .    41.3755
<BOS> Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law .    49.5205
<BOS> Once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear .    39.4459
<BOS> Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? - - A glass of wine ; - - shall I get you one ? - - You are very ill . " " No , I thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to recover herself .    28.7140
<BOS> Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness .    30.1689
<BOS> I will try again .    37.6004
<BOS> You refuse , then , to oblige me .    29.8029
<BOS> Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Mr . Collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton .    32.9785
<BOS> But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .    22.6879
<BOS> " How I long to see her again !    22.0939
<BOS> who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust . - - How humiliating is this discovery ! - - Yet , how just a humiliation ! - - Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind .    30.0252
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet could hardly comprehend it .    10.9658
<BOS> " I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . "    17.1584
<BOS> But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable .    28.7125
<BOS> " When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other . "    21.5875
<BOS> Perhaps she is full young to be much in company .    63.6445
<BOS> " I have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech .    13.5030
<BOS> They followed her into the dining - parlour .    11.3895
<BOS> I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .    44.1101
<BOS> There was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .    23.9662
<BOS> Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the - - - - shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . "    31.1926
<BOS> Darcy ? - - You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . "    24.8209
<BOS> They had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister .    39.6788
<BOS> no - - it is not for me to be driven away by Mr . Darcy .    18.1778
<BOS> Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten .    39.7689
<BOS> Indeed he has no improper pride .    38.0754
<BOS> it must be my uncle's doings !    31.8769
<BOS> But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .    32.4588
<BOS> Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .    29.5874
<BOS> Collins . "    12.9425
<BOS> Had I but explained some part of it only - - some part of what I learnt , to my own family !    46.9156
<BOS> A few days after this visit , Mr . Bingley called again , and alone .    14.7730
<BOS> The period of expectation was now doubled .    34.1179
<BOS> My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance .    26.4478
<BOS> Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , " Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .    26.8963
<BOS> " My dear Mr . Bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome !    7.4562
<BOS> He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .    38.5156
<BOS> The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .    21.1665
<BOS> This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr . Wickham's being among them .    33.4711
<BOS> " Yes , very different .    12.3584
<BOS> " No really , " replied Elizabeth ; " I think there cannot be too little said on the subject . "    14.9962
<BOS> The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken .    38.0481
<BOS> Oh , Lydia ! "    24.4982
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .    40.4627
<BOS> Elizabeth said no more - - but her mind could not acquiesce .    19.3385
<BOS> And what sort of young lady is she ?    32.2325
<BOS> They were ignorant , idle , and vain .    18.8579
<BOS> It was a rational scheme to be sure !    23.3550
<BOS> There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .    30.0601
<BOS> But you have chosen your fault well . - - I really cannot laugh at it .    38.4223
<BOS> My mother was in hysterics , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done !    20.5987
<BOS> Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr . Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward .    40.1459
<BOS> He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good - natured , gossiping Lucases .    47.7011
<BOS> You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane .    16.6074
<BOS> He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .    38.6537
<BOS> Your's , & c . " EDW .    7.5720
<BOS> He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .    45.0458
<BOS> " He is indeed - - but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? "    27.7437
<BOS> If I could but see you as happy !    39.1756
<BOS> " It was a subject which they could not mention before me . "    20.1577
<BOS> said Miss Bingley ; " will she be as tall as I am ? "    24.0380
<BOS> But gracious me !    87.1573
<BOS> As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs . Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .    40.3586
<BOS> Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .    54.5400
<BOS> We have not met since the th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . "    23.2090
<BOS> I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .    53.0657
<BOS> After a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .    26.7193
<BOS> Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , " I can guess the subject of your reverie . "    26.7022
<BOS> " Oh ! "    4.0393
<BOS> It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .    49.5116
<BOS> It was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ; - - and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .    31.3014
<BOS> Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .    23.4990
<BOS> You are not well enough ; - - you cannot go yourself . "    16.8044
<BOS> He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , " My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? - - Mr .    25.2708
<BOS> Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .    37.8504
<BOS> Wickham's affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia's for him .    58.6095
<BOS> I hope your plans in favour of the - - - - shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . "    14.9499
<BOS> " Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . - - Will you hear it ? "    30.9905
<BOS> So imprudent a match on both sides ! - - But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .    27.9219
<BOS> " Blame you !    17.6983
<BOS> To no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .    51.3757
<BOS> " We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said Elizabeth .    30.7466
<BOS> your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . - - Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .    47.1940
<BOS> He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .    30.0974
<BOS> Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship's indignation would have been .    36.6159
<BOS> After a short silence , the lady first spoke .    27.5654
<BOS> He was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .    26.5742
<BOS> Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance .    58.7536
<BOS> The evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary .    34.2189
<BOS> Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate .    45.2583
<BOS> But that is nothing to us .    15.7423
<BOS> What will Wickham say ?    98.1026
<BOS> Mr . Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .    33.4354
<BOS> nonsense , how can you talk so !    48.2887
<BOS> In short , I will do my best . "    27.1753
<BOS> that abominable Mr .    62.2610
<BOS> But if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs . Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . "    33.7601
<BOS> " How near it may be to mine , I cannot pretend to say . - - You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . "    21.7816
<BOS> Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us .    48.9106
<BOS> You will be a very happy woman . "    9.7989
<BOS> Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .    33.2532
<BOS> He was full of joy and attention .    23.0461
<BOS> There is nothing he would not do for her . "    16.2275
<BOS> Must it be so ? "    46.5880
<BOS> For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter .    27.0535
<BOS> The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield .    51.6150
<BOS> I did for you .    35.2247
<BOS> Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room .    32.4754
<BOS> " It must have been his sister's doing .    18.9674
<BOS> Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish .    52.1724
<BOS> I am sure you will be very comfortable there .    8.7785
<BOS> " But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure .    13.7227
<BOS> " What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment .    21.2921
<BOS> My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . "    49.6297
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .    23.6754
<BOS> But the case is this .    26.1981
<BOS> " I do not believe Mrs . Long will do any such thing .    15.4582
<BOS> " Bingley . "    25.3766
<BOS> I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . "    16.9164
<BOS> " By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent .    34.5956
<BOS> That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .    63.4901
<BOS> But with me , it is not so .    11.6117
<BOS> She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct .    23.0233
<BOS> And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .    22.4138
<BOS> Then addressing her daughter , " Oh !    18.0343
<BOS> it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .    44.9736
<BOS> He has more to give .    30.3757
<BOS> It mortifies me .    29.6823
<BOS> cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . "    32.6386
<BOS> " Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them .    21.9013
<BOS> This cannot be ! - - engaged to Mr . Darcy !    18.8550
<BOS> " No , nothing at all . "    9.9776
<BOS> " Not one . "    16.7122
<BOS> Darcy ! "    10.2942
<BOS> He was angry .    18.0539
<BOS> And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? "    46.4070
<BOS> He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .    23.2632
<BOS> The second began .    45.5591
<BOS> She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .    33.5563
<BOS> The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .    25.7592
<BOS> They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited .    40.0450
<BOS> The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw .    57.3543
<BOS> Your tempers are by no means unlike .    27.1587
<BOS> Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous .    41.8371
<BOS> It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us .    12.3266
<BOS> Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .    27.6309
<BOS> With no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . - - The envelope itself was likewise full . - - Pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .    57.3190
<BOS> His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .    30.9285
<BOS> But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? "    56.8968
<BOS> " This is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune !    30.2017
<BOS> My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ?    34.1885
<BOS> Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re - kindled the admiration of her former lover .    46.8569
<BOS> Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .    36.6063
<BOS> Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Mr . Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . "    17.4309
<BOS> " And have you heard from him often ? "    22.2732
<BOS> Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .    34.0106
<BOS> The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune .    34.0917
<BOS> They were hopeless of remedy .    17.3203
<BOS> At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance .    26.7536
<BOS> Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married .    32.8950
<BOS> She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality - - deliberated on the probability of each statement - - but with little success .    36.6190
<BOS> " And do you like her ? "    9.2152
<BOS> In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .    19.5433
<BOS> The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .    36.6109
<BOS> You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .    41.8574
<BOS> " I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with him I believe it does not often happen .    21.1257
<BOS> I had not believed it possible . "    21.7742
<BOS> This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .    47.4133
<BOS> While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner . - - Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at St . James's .    34.7850
<BOS> On entering the drawing - room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book .    32.7285
<BOS> " Thank you - - but I always mend my own . "    18.4186
<BOS> And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .    42.9159
<BOS> Mr . Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr . Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .    34.1013
<BOS> " A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever . "    24.4340
<BOS> He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .    35.7678
<BOS> My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . "    30.3423
<BOS> Family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .    47.6249
<BOS> If she does not object to it , why should we ? "    24.9658
<BOS> The subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .    21.6609
<BOS> It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .    15.8518
<BOS> He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman - like man , asked her how she had liked him .    26.9294
<BOS> GARDINER . "    7.5923
<BOS> You cannot have been always at Longbourn . "    16.5714
<BOS> What congratulations will then flow in !    187.3550
<BOS> It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy .    33.6548
<BOS> " I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried Elizabeth .    14.1828
<BOS> To be sure , you knew no actual good of me - - but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . "    31.3976
<BOS> Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet .    29.7550
<BOS> " I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . "    33.2525
<BOS> But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .    26.1327
<BOS> Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .    14.1836
<BOS> " I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .    12.9959
<BOS> But his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr . Wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .    28.5590
<BOS> " You observed it , Mr . Darcy , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley ; " and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition . "    10.2413
<BOS> " Oh , lord !    8.7564
<BOS> Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart - felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .    42.7472
<BOS> He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .    27.9322
<BOS> The tumult of her mind was now painfully great .    22.3686
<BOS> Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs . Bennet and the children .    27.0915
<BOS> Why does she not come in ? "    80.0287
<BOS> " ' Tis too much ! "    10.3547
<BOS> Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy .    17.1781
<BOS> Does he know his real character ? "    41.1609
<BOS> Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? "    23.4063
<BOS> - - And upon Elizabeth's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr .    74.7013
<BOS> But now it was all too natural .    38.3596
<BOS> His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .    33.2215
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> how can it affect them ? "    36.0767
<BOS> " Yes , very handsome . "    9.3606
<BOS> Two days after Mr . Bennet's return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , " I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . "    25.3101
<BOS> Good bye . "    62.6731
<BOS> To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? "    45.6046
<BOS> I will leave him to himself . "    13.9244
<BOS> She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .    33.4731
<BOS> Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention .    19.5887
<BOS> " And do you really know all this ? "    12.8297
<BOS> " You are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . "    13.3553
<BOS> He drew a chair near her .    33.0626
<BOS> It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . "    12.7136
<BOS> " Has she been presented ?    56.2091
<BOS> As they drove to Mr . Gardiner's door , Jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever .    27.9859
<BOS> Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were .    32.5047
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> What could be the meaning of it ? - - It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know .    25.2934
<BOS> Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .    22.5230
<BOS> It would have been strange if they had .    30.3827
<BOS> But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a rival of Jane .    15.9426
<BOS> But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .    53.9873
<BOS> But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . "    26.0465
<BOS> And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had !    46.8540
<BOS> Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology , " " Hunsford , " and " Lady Catherine de Bourgh . "    22.3007
<BOS> " You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , - - therefore you need not conceal your age . "    19.5100
<BOS> Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .    25.4305
<BOS> " But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded .    23.0120
<BOS> Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .    21.7524
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a - year .    31.8143
<BOS> You must not disappoint your father . "    13.3463
<BOS> Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .    41.8242
<BOS> I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F . is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W . was not a man to be trusted .    34.5988
<BOS> I do think Mrs . Long is as good a creature as ever lived - - and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . "    40.4269
<BOS> Is nothing due to me on that score ?    72.5609
<BOS> She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side .    38.7313
<BOS> Mrs . Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones's shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane's introduction of him .    30.7037
<BOS> All was joy and kindness .    70.5399
<BOS> " Indeed ! "    7.8892
<BOS> " Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? "    28.2814
<BOS> She had very little notice from any but him .    34.2994
<BOS> Collins . "    12.9425
<BOS> Her mind was less difficult to develope .    18.2779
<BOS> " Is it not clear enough ? - - Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! )    55.1276
<BOS> His surprise was great .    38.9753
<BOS> " That is to say , you had given your permission .    22.3308
<BOS> Elizabeth could not but look surprised .    33.7299
<BOS> Mr . Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr . Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .    26.2160
<BOS> We seem to have been designed for each other . "    16.1609
<BOS> Lydia - - the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .    39.9105
<BOS> If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning .    26.2251
<BOS> " I believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied Wickham ; " I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .    22.8228
<BOS> Did you see it ? "    14.8199
<BOS> My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect .    60.5391
<BOS> I must speak to Hill , this moment . "    22.9601
<BOS> But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .    29.5930
<BOS> " I hope not so .    20.0724
<BOS> We were always good friends ; and now we are better . "    19.2121
<BOS> Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .    66.9820
<BOS> " Yes , my youngest is not sixteen .    16.5972
<BOS> She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .    30.2684
<BOS> I felt a little uneasy - - a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .    25.4166
<BOS> " You must decide for yourself , " said Elizabeth , " and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . "    23.4579
<BOS> But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "    24.2442
<BOS> I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son - in - law . "    32.6654
<BOS> The very last evening was spent there ; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .    41.9710
<BOS> When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .    22.0659
<BOS> It cannot last long .    52.6641
<BOS> But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .    66.1591
<BOS> Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , " I did not know before that you ever walked this way . "    36.3649
<BOS> The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret .    29.5793
<BOS> " As I did the other day , " said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that .    21.3677
<BOS> " But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune . "    41.6338
<BOS> " What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ? "    14.1962
<BOS> I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . "    42.8945
<BOS> At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted - - - - " He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other .    23.3035
<BOS> Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection .    47.8997
<BOS> The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .    34.5742
<BOS> Anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing - room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .    32.5580
<BOS> She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place .    41.9765
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> They entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .    40.1246
<BOS> It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .    32.5547
<BOS> " And have you answered the letter ? "    13.4644
<BOS> " And that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr . Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London !    24.0898
<BOS> " Indeed ! "    7.8892
<BOS> One day's delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .    31.3330
<BOS> " I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? "    27.1638
<BOS> Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .    53.0154
<BOS> You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . "    32.1188
<BOS> Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .    42.0404
<BOS> In spite of having been at St . James's , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .    29.1149
<BOS> He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . - - But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . - - To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .    42.7948
<BOS> Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William's too long .    38.7713
<BOS> Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .    77.1923
<BOS> Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .    86.5805
<BOS> I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .    41.0942
<BOS> Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?    69.7455
<BOS> " You are too hasty , Sir , " she cried .    15.2438
<BOS> Mr . Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !    30.5108
<BOS> I shall be back by dinner . "    16.7422
<BOS> Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .    21.0971
<BOS> It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn .    30.5038
<BOS> Darcy ! - - and so it does I vow .    28.4176
<BOS> Why was he to be the judge ? "    53.1704
<BOS> How is such a man to be worked on ?    22.9532
<BOS> I do not believe she often sees such at home . "    26.5411
<BOS> What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?    46.5470
<BOS> For your sake , " turning to Charlotte , " I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . - - It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family . - - Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? "    25.7537
<BOS> I am confident that she would have performed delightfully .    19.3196
<BOS> Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings .    25.8589
<BOS> When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr . Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr . Bingley for his sister .    32.5894
<BOS> If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . "    21.2427
<BOS> Well !    52.3421
<BOS> " Oh ! - - you mean Jane , I suppose - - because he danced with her twice .    17.6291
<BOS> Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .    70.9060
<BOS> And then we were so merry all the way home !    46.5058
<BOS> " In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .    23.2135
<BOS> His revenge would have been complete indeed .    27.3209
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .    23.4900
<BOS> It was as follows : " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire .    34.0454
<BOS> Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .    47.1706
<BOS> It is a pity they are not handsome !    20.7514
<BOS> Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming .    30.4776
<BOS> After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr . Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball .    38.8644
<BOS> " I do not know . - - I hope there was . - - But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult .    14.8934
<BOS> But what does he say of the living ? "    19.8184
<BOS> They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .    24.9049
<BOS> The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .    26.5443
<BOS> But they did pass away , and Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn .    20.4179
<BOS> She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour .    17.5413
<BOS> " I do not know when I have been more shocked , " said she .    9.8129
<BOS> She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her .    36.8469
<BOS> Their reception at home was most kind .    24.4893
<BOS> who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .    42.6273
<BOS> " He has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !    18.2716
<BOS> And gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , " Dear Ma'am , do not go . - - I beg you will not go . - - Mr .    20.9549
<BOS> " No , I believe not . "    9.8104
<BOS> For my part , Mr . Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently .    54.9401
<BOS> And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .    30.8086
<BOS> " Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . "    32.1706
<BOS> " My dear Mr . Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . - - When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .    27.1429
<BOS> " Merely to the illustration of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .    19.0227
<BOS> I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on .    31.3557
<BOS> I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you . "    40.0838
<BOS> You shall hear what she says . "    15.3566
<BOS> But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .    23.9577
<BOS> By tea - time however the dose had been enough , and Mr . Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing - room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .    25.6440
<BOS> my dear Lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? "    22.8706
<BOS> I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . "    25.7163
<BOS> But of course she did not mention my name to you . "    20.2944
<BOS> They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry .    50.3445
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .    22.6750
<BOS> They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ?    34.1789
<BOS> You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .    54.4425
<BOS> " I have been making the tour of the Park , " he replied , " as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage .    23.2747
<BOS> Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .    34.1330
<BOS> My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .    28.3221
<BOS> They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . Bingley's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .    43.1766
<BOS> Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . "    23.6071
<BOS> cried Elizabeth ; " but how could that be ? - - How could his will be disregarded ? - - Why did not you seek legal redress ? "    37.0223
<BOS> " That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask .    22.3822
<BOS> I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit .    42.2440
<BOS> Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .    25.0684
<BOS> Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .    28.8693
<BOS> But these are not Jane's feelings ; she is not acting by design .    49.7355
<BOS> By Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .    29.6728
<BOS> what is it about ?    45.7872
<BOS> " Are you quite sure , Ma'am ? - - is not there a little mistake ? "    26.4411
<BOS> Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs . Bennet give up the point .    26.2288
<BOS> The gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr . Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .    28.5710
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .    33.1365
<BOS> He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .    35.4890
<BOS> A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .    27.4752
<BOS> Bennet ? "    33.5327
<BOS> He has not an ill - natured look .    21.7912
<BOS> I mend pens remarkably well . "    23.9714
<BOS> His character was decided .    15.1271
<BOS> The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank - - such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine .    39.2379
<BOS> " You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . "    21.7256
<BOS> And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information .    44.7796
<BOS> She did not fear her father's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .    34.1406
<BOS> To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .    24.0575
<BOS> What is it you are talking of ?    51.6659
<BOS> Mr . Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god - son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed .    33.6528
<BOS> Elizabeth did not know what to make of it .    19.8744
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> Have a little compassion on my nerves .    33.2057
<BOS> Her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .    38.6603
<BOS> The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .    29.5918
<BOS> " Miss Bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with .    16.4116
<BOS> You have a sweet room here , Mr . Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .    28.3753
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel .    24.4970
<BOS> " Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you .    33.0830
<BOS> I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .    22.8402
<BOS> Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr . Wickham .    21.1880
<BOS> But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . "    53.7538
<BOS> " And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . "    24.9546
<BOS> " Indeed , Mr . Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .    22.1296
<BOS> what news ?    118.2750
<BOS> and his sisters are charming women .    45.3826
<BOS> " I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley's sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .    23.6023
<BOS> What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !    43.3548
<BOS> Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr . Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr . Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .    26.5457
<BOS> " What is his name ? "    12.5421
<BOS> " For the liveliness of your mind , I did . "    21.7650
<BOS> His most particular friend , you see by Jane's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .    52.3945
<BOS> " From what we have seen of him , " continued Mrs . Gardiner , " I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham .    22.2977
<BOS> Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr . Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .    27.4853
<BOS> We acted with the best intentions . "    29.3744
<BOS> As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner .    30.9338
<BOS> Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister .    29.5916
<BOS> " Can I have the carriage ? "    13.1432
<BOS> " Mr . Bingley does not know Mr . Wickham himself ? "    8.9286
<BOS> My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs . Hurst were going out .    27.3272
<BOS> You may depend upon my seeking no further . "    22.5973
<BOS> The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . "    38.3892
<BOS> One must speak a little , you know .    29.2427
<BOS> She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .    25.9786
<BOS> But Mrs . Bennet , was not so well pleased with it .    12.4720
<BOS> Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .    48.5205
<BOS> A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two .    38.1174
<BOS> The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady's fair , flowing hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .    36.1538
<BOS> That is the place to get husbands .    25.3780
<BOS> The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came , and Mrs . Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth .    31.9515
<BOS> No , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr . Collins in time . "    26.7439
<BOS> Now what have you to say ? "    29.2322
<BOS> His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn .    43.8538
<BOS> A lady's imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .    54.1192
<BOS> " That is not an unnatural surmise , " said Fitzwilliam , " but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly . "    17.0875
<BOS> Lady Catherine seemed pleased .    17.6100
<BOS> and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son ?    39.0266
<BOS> It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .    32.3766
<BOS> What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err .    32.6991
<BOS> In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .    23.6913
<BOS> We want none of them ; do we ? "    62.9098
<BOS> " I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , - - and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .    21.0452
<BOS> He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one .    42.5416
<BOS> Her father lifted up his eyes .    18.9785
<BOS> Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of - - or I may say , three very silly sisters .    51.0797
<BOS> Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .    30.6892
<BOS> Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs . Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .    34.0197
<BOS> " Of what are you talking ? "    14.1612
<BOS> And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty .    23.1519
<BOS> " There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . "    43.6622
<BOS> Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . "    33.0118
<BOS> The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .    33.5634
<BOS> I hope we may often meet again . "    19.6969
<BOS> " But the wife of Mr . Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . "    31.6001
<BOS> Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure .    32.7619
<BOS> His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by .    30.2840
<BOS> What a stroke was this for poor Jane !    68.3384
<BOS> He was on one side of her mother .    15.9213
<BOS> " Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? "    29.0838
<BOS> and to see dear Wickham too !    323.8332
<BOS> " Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .    12.5467
<BOS> Bingley ? "    14.2738
<BOS> Respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .    40.4767
<BOS> But vanity , not love , has been my folly . - - Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned .    37.5609
<BOS> Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth .    15.7348
<BOS> You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .    43.5994
<BOS> When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her . - - Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr . Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . - - I am excessively attentive to all those things .    36.9825
<BOS> Mr . Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family .    34.3613
<BOS> And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry .    35.3054
<BOS> It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner .    21.5335
<BOS> " My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .    18.5580
<BOS> " How good it was in you , my dear Mr . Bennet !    17.2597
<BOS> There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much .    27.6443
<BOS> Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him .    16.7555
<BOS> " But you - - How are you ? "    11.1750
<BOS> But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done .    14.2291
<BOS> There was no help for it however .    21.7419
<BOS> She blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .    30.1203
<BOS> Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .    30.1362
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : " You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly .    37.7549
<BOS> It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham .    37.0313
<BOS> To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .    41.9924
<BOS> " Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied Elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .    34.3175
<BOS> And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .    33.8620
<BOS> You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham .    40.6872
<BOS> When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were .    37.6724
<BOS> " Mrs . Annesley is with her .    21.0264
<BOS> Bennet . "    24.3530
<BOS> " They will join me early to - morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , - - Mr . Bingley and his sisters . "    23.0799
<BOS> If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . "    21.2499
<BOS> In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh !    29.3626
<BOS> Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth .    11.7606
<BOS> " I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself .    33.5000
<BOS> She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .    28.1064
<BOS> " Sure he will not leave London before he has found them .    29.7479
<BOS> Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .    38.2208
<BOS> I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .    37.7513
<BOS> I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .    10.3541
<BOS> Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .    11.8911
<BOS> When first Mr . Bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son .    39.8568
<BOS> If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once .    31.9916
<BOS> I am very , very sorry .    29.6628
<BOS> I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . "    50.0443
<BOS> But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs . Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion .    33.8353
<BOS> Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable - - that one false step involves her in endless ruin - - that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , - - and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . "    42.4381
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .    23.7080
<BOS> As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . "    22.3778
<BOS> Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . "    54.5998
<BOS> Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .    27.6477
<BOS> Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .    84.6291
<BOS> Elizabeth almost stared at her . - - " Can this be Mr .    37.0793
<BOS> This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .    47.7199
<BOS> Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! "    53.2689
<BOS> How shall we punish him for such a speech ? "    22.6095
<BOS> His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great intelligence .    30.6117
<BOS> My fingers wait your orders . "    41.3867
<BOS> But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet .    32.3624
<BOS> " My real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me .    31.0641
<BOS> " And this is your real opinion !    28.7422
<BOS> " Well , Lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ?    29.7316
<BOS> For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions .    39.4733
<BOS> It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention .    22.5900
<BOS> One enjoyment was certain - - that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences - - cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure - - and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .    56.4397
<BOS> Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .    38.2570
<BOS> The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers .    37.5220
<BOS> I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage . "    21.2696
<BOS> I wish you had been there .    14.5030
<BOS> " And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .    30.2214
<BOS> But still he would be her husband . - - Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .    63.5658
<BOS> How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton !    37.2586
<BOS> Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " Oh !    27.5763
<BOS> But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .    43.0061
<BOS> Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone .    33.9316
<BOS> She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be .    22.9237
<BOS> " You shall hear then - - but prepare yourself for something very dreadful .    38.2684
<BOS> Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance .    31.8885
<BOS> " Miss Bingley told me , " said Jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .    23.0820
<BOS> Darcy ? "    9.4573
<BOS> He then said , " I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .    24.7451
<BOS> The latter was thinking only of his breakfast .    40.7256
<BOS> " How could I ever think her like her nephew ? "    41.2829
<BOS> " Yes ; to the last .    26.8559
<BOS> " Nay , " said Elizabeth , " this is not fair .    8.7873
<BOS> " There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , - - Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? "    29.6503
<BOS> Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .    32.3929
<BOS> said her aunt .    24.1948
<BOS> This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities .    45.4688
<BOS> He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .    25.2646
<BOS> " Well , " cried Elizabeth , " have it as you choose .    12.4238
<BOS> The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .    23.1833
<BOS> Mr . Collins was also in the same state of angry pride .    18.7038
<BOS> My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . "    33.3885
<BOS> She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .    40.8271
<BOS> Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?    61.0407
<BOS> But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ; they are even impartial towards Miss King .    55.3082
<BOS> I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . "    34.4172
<BOS> To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the <NUMBER> per cents .    31.7611
<BOS> She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances : - - and to have Mr . Collins instead !    53.3873
<BOS> " A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .    54.9943
<BOS> Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately .    30.3771
<BOS> Such a countenance , such manners !    31.2864
<BOS> " You may depend upon my not mentioning it . "    12.0563
<BOS> " If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins - - but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . "    29.3318
<BOS> Elizabeth smiled .    16.2144
<BOS> Mr . Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr . Bingley never stirs without him . "    32.5402
<BOS> An union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .    24.5930
<BOS> The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .    40.4730
<BOS> She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs . Forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home .    32.9460
<BOS> We must have Mrs . Long and the Gouldings soon .    26.5572
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> Mrs . Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr . Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home .    25.2044
<BOS> " Well , then - - supposing them to be in London .    16.4421
<BOS> " Your's , & c . " This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .    28.1890
<BOS> Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley .    37.4514
<BOS> For God's sake , say no more of his partners .    38.3705
<BOS> Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .    26.5067
<BOS> I can recal nothing worse .    31.7047
<BOS> Mr . Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and Sir William , to Elizabeth's high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way .    25.2545
<BOS> She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .    38.3891
<BOS> " Very well - - and this offer of marriage you have refused ? "    17.0312
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .    27.6058
<BOS> But , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined .    27.2885
<BOS> A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . "    62.8689
<BOS> " They have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . "    30.5374
<BOS> " Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said Mr . Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .    15.1139
<BOS> It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing .    25.8896
<BOS> You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .    31.7366
<BOS> If he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him .    44.2564
<BOS> My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .    34.1246
<BOS> " This will not do , " said Elizabeth .    8.8578
<BOS> " I have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .    20.2838
<BOS> A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .    44.4262
<BOS> What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park , when he put his letter into her hand !    50.6324
<BOS> That he was surprised by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr . Gardiner .    26.0310
<BOS> Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .    32.7076
<BOS> She was going to the butcher's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed . "    25.7313
<BOS> " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth .    52.6716
<BOS> She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " Ah !    38.6975
<BOS> And then when we came away it was such fun !    35.2551
<BOS> Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy's progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .    35.7845
<BOS> " Is this , " thought Elizabeth , " meant for me ? "    15.7913
<BOS> I am so pleased - - so happy .    30.7554
<BOS> The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .    20.5519
<BOS> " You know nothing of the matter .    9.5902
<BOS> cried Lydia .    14.2142
<BOS> Smiles decked the face of Mrs . Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .    36.2868
<BOS> Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .    23.4561
<BOS> I have not been used to submit to any person's whims .    22.7528
<BOS> " His father was an excellent man , " said Mrs . Gardiner .    11.0264
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street .    26.2012
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .    15.5386
<BOS> She felt anew the justice of Mr . Darcy's objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend .    28.3116
<BOS> Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .    29.8694
<BOS> - - cried Elizabeth .    23.3765
<BOS> The officer was the very Mr . Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .    46.2269
<BOS> He comes down on Thursday at the latest , very likely on Wednesday .    46.1824
<BOS> It has often led him to be liberal and generous , - - to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor .    34.4369
<BOS> " This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , " said he .    9.8803
<BOS> Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , - - that I am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day .    46.8879
<BOS> Bromley , of course . - - If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to . "    25.0698
<BOS> When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument .    23.8270
<BOS> A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .    31.1663
<BOS> It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . "    39.6944
<BOS> Poor Jane !    36.2892
<BOS> Mr . Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise .    22.4882
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .    16.3228
<BOS> " Not at all , " he replied ; " they were brightened by the exercise . "    12.2368
<BOS> Why any fear of detection ?    92.9986
<BOS> " Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam .    12.0212
<BOS> " Yes - - but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . "    16.7205
<BOS> Mr . Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .    24.0964
<BOS> Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .    13.5688
<BOS> " I beg your pardon .    7.8393
<BOS> Poor little Lizzy !    51.4909
<BOS> It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning .    27.7133
<BOS> But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed .    58.6938
<BOS> Society , I own , is necessary to me .    43.0779
<BOS> Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , while Mrs . Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor .    22.5775
<BOS> There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .    14.0504
<BOS> I see the imprudence of it . - - Oh !    13.0428
<BOS> " My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . "    19.9899
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it .    13.3700
<BOS> She replied in the affirmative .    41.3257
<BOS> - - It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .    33.3618
<BOS> He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed .    26.6464
<BOS> " From the former .    32.2259
<BOS> She will follow wherever Lydia leads .    82.9437
<BOS> Lydia was Lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .    65.0520
<BOS> It was gratitude . - - Gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .    38.9814
<BOS> then - - some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .    41.7992
<BOS> We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .    35.5635
<BOS> On their being joined by Mr . Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr . Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .    30.8116
<BOS> The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .    32.4778
<BOS> Mr . Darcy replied with great intrepidity , " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . "    11.7796
<BOS> Hope was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .    32.2202
<BOS> If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .    39.8681
<BOS> " Yes , almost every day . "    12.0090
<BOS> When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister - in - law of the card - table - - but in vain .    30.1254
<BOS> It is admirable ! "    15.9768
<BOS> Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .    27.5691
<BOS> Darcy . "    8.5964
<BOS> Mr . Collins was eloquent in her praise .    14.1501
<BOS> Jane now came up .    26.7061
<BOS> " How should you have liked making sermons ? "    23.6517
<BOS> He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying - - and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . "    23.8874
<BOS> But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . "    27.3413
<BOS> But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . "    19.6580
<BOS> " Read it aloud , " said their father , " for I hardly know myself what it is about . "    17.5968
<BOS> Your sister I also watched . - - Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment . - - If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error .    32.1831
<BOS> I am ashamed of you !    15.2675
<BOS> His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .    34.0414
<BOS> He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish . "    25.5483
<BOS> Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .    37.5706
<BOS> " Very well . - - That reply will do for the present . - - Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . - - But now we may be silent . "    40.3018
<BOS> Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? - - Impossible .    37.4675
<BOS> She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! - - What do you think has happened this morning ? - - Mr .    25.7085
<BOS> A most welcome negative followed the last question - - and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .    31.4063
<BOS> Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ; and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .    36.1043
<BOS> " And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? "    21.5836
<BOS> Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business .    36.4650
<BOS> " Though it is difficult , " said Jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . "    32.5395
<BOS> He who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .    40.6840
<BOS> Elizabeth now began to revive .    19.1049
<BOS> " I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied .    24.6874
<BOS> To Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .    19.5786
<BOS> At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family .    18.3833
<BOS> How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? "    31.7399
<BOS> Did you see him while you were at Lambton ?    25.3786
<BOS> But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year .    32.1459
<BOS> Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs . Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by the bye , Mrs . Forster and me are such friends ! )    30.4342
<BOS> She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .    41.2469
<BOS> Mr . Collins made his declaration in form .    26.8338
<BOS> Mr . Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last Mr . Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .    31.4732
<BOS> " Nay , " cried Bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .    27.9990
<BOS> And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ?    67.3048
<BOS> What he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . "    48.1797
<BOS> She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .    51.5000
<BOS> It was a journey of only twenty - four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch - street by noon .    33.9221
<BOS> The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty - seven , was Elizabeth's intimate friend .    36.3471
<BOS> * * * * * Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .    12.0381
<BOS> But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .    39.4027
<BOS> What will you think of my vanity ?    23.0032
<BOS> But of this answer Lydia heard not a word .    67.5648
<BOS> He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else .    18.6530
<BOS> You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . "    27.0645
<BOS> my dear , " said Maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not Lady Catherine .    22.4098
<BOS> The next was in these words .    28.8905
<BOS> It was at Sir William Lucas's , where a large party were assembled .    28.7965
<BOS> I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .    31.2081
<BOS> Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .    27.7484
<BOS> Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Mr . Collins .    29.0500
<BOS> When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .    36.1179
<BOS> " Yours , & c . " " Well , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr . Bingley , and under your orders . "    15.6885
<BOS> " My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken .    24.7985
<BOS> Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . "    48.9153
<BOS> They are gone off together from Brighton .    28.4944
<BOS> You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .    17.8987
<BOS> Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .    42.3141
<BOS> " It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . "    23.1592
<BOS> I quite forgot !    53.4101
<BOS> Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . "    29.3673
<BOS> And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North .    22.7681
<BOS> All field sports were over .    23.2243
<BOS> Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .    26.3434
<BOS> Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . "    24.5983
<BOS> She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it .    15.9551
<BOS> or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?    93.7646
<BOS> She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .    26.1756
<BOS> Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr . Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .    26.2094
<BOS> " Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy .    17.6635
<BOS> And with a bow to Mr . Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . - - Many stared . - - Many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr . Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr . Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half - whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .    26.0661
<BOS> " I believe , Ma'am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him . "    17.8260
<BOS> " No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . "    33.0194
<BOS> Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body . "    41.9896
<BOS> With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .    19.7033
<BOS> " I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . "    30.0202
<BOS> " It did .    20.6487
<BOS> The party did not supply much conversation .    31.9786
<BOS> " But does Lydia know nothing of this ?    27.7600
<BOS> But to be candid without ostentation or design - - to take the good of every body's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad - - belongs to you alone .    37.2216
<BOS> She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " Oh , my dear Eliza !    22.2301
<BOS> " Then , " observed Elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . "    16.3995
<BOS> " Oh !    3.3160
<BOS> Mr . Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .    31.6021
<BOS> " This is not to be borne .    11.0814
<BOS> Darcy smiled and said , " You are perfectly right .    25.0783
<BOS> I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs .    18.0108
<BOS> Oh !    7.3674
<BOS> Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .    32.2085
<BOS> Mrs . Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed .    29.7216
<BOS> As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases , were seated in it .    27.0439
<BOS> " I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a - year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . "    45.1006
<BOS> She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend .    19.8581
<BOS> As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . "    29.5022
<BOS> Mr . Darcy !    6.7452
<BOS> How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !    37.0721
<BOS> " I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill - treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him .    28.5129
<BOS> Mrs . Philips's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs . Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar .    28.3588
<BOS> Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . "    49.0147
<BOS> At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .    26.2513
<BOS> yes - - it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again .    35.0191
<BOS> Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .    26.2679
<BOS> He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask .    18.9197
<BOS> On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .    28.8097
<BOS> " To yield readily - - easily - - to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you . "    41.6441
<BOS> Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?    37.1292
<BOS> Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . "    24.7044
<BOS> " It is difficult indeed - - it is distressing . - - One does not know what to think . "    16.9254
<BOS> " Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? "    30.1425
<BOS> Pray do not talk of that odious man .    27.7789
<BOS> No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; - - a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .    38.9055
<BOS> If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient .    14.2374
<BOS> My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own .    63.3221
<BOS> She studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .    42.9809
<BOS> No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind .    58.9562
<BOS> " Yes , " replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . "    28.4746
<BOS> Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .    40.6132
<BOS> The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .    25.4361
<BOS> Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to - night .    33.8905
<BOS> Women fancy admiration means more than it does . "    63.2691
<BOS> " There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .    29.2191
<BOS> Till Elizabeth entered the drawing - room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr . Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .    30.6857
<BOS> By this time she is actually with them !    29.1513
<BOS> " You are joking , Lizzy .    11.0899
<BOS> " Mrs . Collins , you must send a servant with them .    18.3706
<BOS> A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little .    50.0459
<BOS> It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations .    26.7898
<BOS> This letter is from Mr .    35.7103
<BOS> My friend has an excellent understanding - - though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr . Collins as the wisest thing she ever did .    37.3275
<BOS> My father was not only fond of this young man's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .    28.5187
<BOS> He had never had the slightest suspicion .    28.9182
<BOS> No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .    35.5820
<BOS> Elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs . Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .    21.1082
<BOS> If Mr . Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?    58.0751
<BOS> Collins , you must marry .    24.7718
<BOS> But I have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest - tempered , most generous - hearted , boy in the world . "    32.1151
<BOS> It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .    33.6913
<BOS> " How can you talk so ? "    10.2042
<BOS> Mr . Hurst and Mr . Bingley were at piquet , and Mrs . Hurst was observing their game .    14.0042
<BOS> " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had .    22.7508
<BOS> No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village .    45.2122
<BOS> in every view it is unaccountable ! "    54.1205
<BOS> They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .    41.3264
<BOS> I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible .    36.8837
<BOS> Mrs . Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .    23.7578
<BOS> But I wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself .    20.6307
<BOS> They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring .    27.1199
<BOS> On the gentlemen's appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .    44.0939
<BOS> She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr . Darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .    36.9838
<BOS> Console Lady Catherine as well as you can .    26.1565
<BOS> The room in which the ladies sat was backwards .    42.7082
<BOS> Mr . Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .    38.5124
<BOS> Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .    20.4257
<BOS> When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . "    36.4274
<BOS> Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .    33.2993
<BOS> I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .    32.7496
<BOS> How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !    50.6474
<BOS> " You look pale .    19.0898
<BOS> Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " To treat in such a manner , the god - son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! "    40.4991
<BOS> What do you keep winking at me for ?    54.9542
<BOS> You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken .    35.8270
<BOS> He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane .    39.1594
<BOS> " You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .    21.3794
<BOS> Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .    31.1652
<BOS> Mrs . Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr . and Mrs . Collins well . "    23.0911
<BOS> And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment .    33.0200
<BOS> He immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded .    79.2894
<BOS> Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .    14.7235
<BOS> And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .    33.9992
<BOS> Too much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ?    37.4047
<BOS> This was a lucky recollection - - it saved her from something like regret .    52.7514
<BOS> Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .    50.9636
<BOS> " My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , " said Charlotte .    25.7888
<BOS> I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr . Darcy .    31.3124
<BOS> Mr . Darcy , who was leaning against the mantle - piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .    19.3985
<BOS> He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire .    18.7428
<BOS> It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . "    28.5142
<BOS> " How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? "    16.5171
<BOS> " I know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , - - and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object .    24.1985
<BOS> Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? "    27.3009
<BOS> Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .    76.3486
<BOS> " I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley .    24.6373
<BOS> Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .    32.6024
<BOS> " I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! "    27.6165
<BOS> " I will not be interrupted .    8.6426
<BOS> how acutely did she now feel it .    30.7262
<BOS> " Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .    38.1129
<BOS> " But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . "    18.2434
<BOS> I dare say the lace upon Mrs . Hurst's gown - - - - " Here she was interrupted again .    21.4187
<BOS> " When I am in the country , " he replied , " I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same .    13.2678

<BOS> She had never heard of him before his entrance into the - - - - shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .    20.5613
<BOS> that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! "    40.0477
<BOS> Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved .    36.0872
<BOS> That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible .    50.1623
<BOS> If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . "    29.2869
<BOS> " You have said quite enough , madam .    24.0893
