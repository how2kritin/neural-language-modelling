54.1968
" Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her .    53.1895
There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter , which promises well .    29.0643
Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public .    29.2964
Mrs . Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .    44.4236
yes , " said Elizabeth drily - - " Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr . Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . "    17.1124
Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ?    73.1865
And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house .    52.1067
" You know nothing of the matter .    19.3168
Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . - - You cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . "    24.3451
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears .    29.0993
" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " I shall know how to understand it .    29.3634
" She did indeed , Louisa .    90.1438
" You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short silence .    36.1688
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away .    28.5758
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs . Long .    25.5766
To the little town of Lambton , the scene of Mrs . Gardiner's former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of    43.4978
Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated .    35.9688
Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown .    62.5639
You know I have .    47.2599
" Oh !    5.3941
" Indeed you are mistaken .    24.6721
" And that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr . Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London !    29.7947
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies .    54.2894
" Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . "    26.5392
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as    65.4946
her accent was peevish .    80.5716
But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . "    39.7139
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld !    38.2109
I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .    48.3672
Mrs . Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment ; but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , " Miss Bennet , there seemed to be    25.3119
a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn .    36.9043
" And your defect is a propensity to hate every body . "    34.7978
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce .    40.8761
" Oh !    5.3941
what is the matter ? "    15.5893
The others have been gone on to Scarborough , these three weeks . "    38.0933
He sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room .    17.6160
This was agreed to , and Mrs . Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards .    42.8460
It was unpardonable .    34.7901
The insipidity and yet the noise ; the nothingness and yet the self - importance of all these people ! - - What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! "    41.7882
Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day .    24.5648
Mr . Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs . Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure .    30.6125
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together .    33.1366
When the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist .    29.8147
The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging .    46.2906
" Oh !    5.3941
" Nay , " said Elizabeth , " this is not fair .    12.6086
" Well , then - - supposing them to be in London .    23.9330
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs . Philips    34.1333
a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could .    41.2641
" Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement .    20.8279
so tall ! - - Oh , my dear Lizzy !    9.5825
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with .    66.4823
But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . "    18.2596
With a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; but she had not got beyond the words " delightful ,    35.0538
" and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed .    77.9610
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away .    35.8717
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .    39.5140
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous .    59.6919
Oh !    1.4661
" I should never have said Mrs . Collins was settled near her family . "    23.1540
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption !    68.5684
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .    39.5833
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr . Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .    33.4658
His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother .    47.2311
Recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . "    39.8603
it must be my uncle's doings !    46.2504
" You may depend on it , " replied the other , " for Mrs . Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was    31.5139
certain true .    115.3446
Philips . - - The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter .    36.3119
After sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to Elizabeth , " I hope you are well , Miss Bennet .    26.0682
" Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . "    74.9744
But Mrs . Bennet , was not so well pleased with it .    16.6328
Mrs . Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : " You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love    60.6018
merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly .    33.5149
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .    79.7499
" I honour your circumspection .    171.9340
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour    59.7938
, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .    133.4946
The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken    55.8639
.    N/A
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy's progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .    45.0924
I am very glad you liked her .    35.3920
For your sake , " turning to Charlotte , " I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . - - It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family . - - Do you play    39.0429
and sing , Miss Bennet ? "    22.5759
" ' Tis too much ! "    19.5965
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .    29.5604
But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among    74.6195
his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place - - which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years .    42.9612
A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year .    33.0050
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing .    49.5939
in every view it is unaccountable ! "    49.1026
No , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr . Collins in time . "    29.8821
" That is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare .    35.9635
It is nearly fifty miles . "    34.0267
Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives .    62.8525
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .    33.4219
For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every    47.9072
particular of these transactions .    93.6027
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . "    17.1354
" I assure you , Madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice .    13.7216
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting .    67.1668
" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned .    23.1142
She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .    38.7325
Her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital .    47.8894
He was very fond of them . "    10.3258
Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? "    30.7144
" We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . "    28.7092
The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .    44.7727
Mrs . Collins knew not what to make of him .    22.0161
Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat - - a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return .    28.9954
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .    39.4662
But now it comes out . "    50.5960
I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs . Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day ,    34.5830
and play on the piano - forte in Mrs . Jenkinson's room .    44.5701
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and    28.7803
lady in a curricle , driving up the street .    56.2231
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .    26.2151
It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham .    47.4953
Good bye . "    35.5847
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments .    41.6639
and her calling here was prodigiously civil !    182.7911
There was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table .    39.1285
Perhaps he thought her too young .    80.5592
is not this an agreeable surprise ? "    98.6923
She practises very constantly . "    58.7889
You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice .    55.1219
" I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .    28.2530
What did Colonel Forster say ?    118.7368
" I advise Mr . Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , " said Mrs . Bennet , " to walk to Oakham Mount this morning .    17.4211
Oh !    1.4661
When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . "    53.7447
The day passed much as the day before had done .    49.0221
He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much    53.1102
spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr . Darcy .    21.6989
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode .    43.9921
And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry .    52.7426
I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr . Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his    32.0018
invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .    14.4141
" Thank you - - but I always mend my own . "    25.8150
Mr . Darcy bowed .    12.1779
Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her waiting - woman was in it .    45.9364
" He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . "    15.9768
He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother - in - law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and    36.5860
to discharge the obligation as soon as he could .    20.9719
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . "    32.7254
Darcy ! - - There is nothing like dancing after all . - - I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . "    21.0226
And she was only sixteen last June .    64.3685
" I certainly shall not .    42.8874
" Aye - - that is because you have the right disposition .    46.3326
At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family .    27.3580
You have done all this !    22.9811
She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .    65.9757
It is highly improper .    41.1679
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself .    34.7367
I ought not to have said a word about it .    23.1541
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr . Darcy looked up .    28.5582
" Then , " observed Elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . "    21.6596
How much you must have gone through ! "    45.3408
The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs . Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , proposed their all walking out .    51.9572
" Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . "    27.3197
I am perfectly satisfied .    22.9361
All were struck with the stranger's air , all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained    54.6841
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot .    58.0692
cried Lydia .    13.9995
Lydia's being settled in the North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity    39.7378
that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites .    39.7254
" Oh !    5.3941
" All ! - - What , all five out at once ?    54.8588
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter .    34.9073
Lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .    58.1370
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject .    45.3639
The supposition did not pain her .    98.5712
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did January and February pass away .    78.8718
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .    35.7976
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected .    47.3513
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .    59.9913
Mrs . Bennet said only , " Nonsense , nonsense ! "    21.2572
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . - - Elizabeth was in agonies .    45.2317
Our poor mother is sadly grieved .    75.1345
She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly    49.1667
attended to her .    54.4480
It is of all subjects my delight .    99.2233
" I must not decide on my own performance . "    22.5357
One enjoyment was certain - - that of suitableness as companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences - - cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure - - and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .    84.4558
I am prodigiously proud of him .    20.0784
But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . "    18.8229
Elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away .    53.2065
Mrs . Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast .    40.5084
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that .    41.2792
" Something very much to the purpose of course .    44.3770
Mr . Darcy !    6.6587
She directly replied , " You need not be frightened .    53.4690
And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs . Long .    26.9789
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? "    41.1191
But perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .    63.1170
She looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest Mary should be singing all night .    67.7581
While these newly - born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing .    106.6903
" This will not do , " said Elizabeth .    12.4590
The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him .    47.4823
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection .    113.5280
Darcy said nothing at all .    57.8871
" Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do . "    23.5553
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for .    47.7487
" Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them .    29.8293
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss    44.7562
Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .    26.0943
It is really too distressing .    44.4852
As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . "    43.9167
Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during    53.0720
the rest of the day .    9.0166
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him .    32.8832
Having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other    74.0424
man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity .    37.9809
Here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .    112.7719
forgive the question - - are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? "    23.5437
Darcy smiled and said , " You are perfectly right .    36.3365
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? "    34.5286
only think !    397.8689
" This is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune !    53.7306
She followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held .    35.6725
" What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ?    153.3184
Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious .    29.8161
My dear Mr . Bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ?    13.1092
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I    42.2702
could . "    76.8134
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great .    33.3679
Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the - - - - shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do .    20.1755
Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last Kitty did , she very innocently said , " What is the matter mamma ?    56.4182
Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately .    48.3544
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment .    49.8697
On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .    41.8158
Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .    77.8995
to put me on my guard ?    76.6131
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well - bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs . Collins , sat for some time without speaking    50.0835
to any body .    60.8518
" He is certainly a good brother , " said Elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows .    20.1985
Poor Charlotte ! - - it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! - - But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion .    33.6291
It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return .    49.4581
Mr . Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr . Bingley .    25.8721
has she any family ? "    202.4176
Change of scene might be of service - - and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . "    46.1545
The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though Elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly    46.1228
aware , that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better .    45.3975
He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty .    53.2870
" My dear , dear aunt , " she rapturously cried , " what delight !    36.0916
" A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe .    132.6657
Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . "    42.2941
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over .    114.6073
" I dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . "    15.8896
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr . Collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr . Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have    29.6494
his library to himself ; for thither Mr . Collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Mr . Bennet , with little cessation , of his house    42.8337
and garden at Hunsford .    39.9287
" I never saw a more promising inclination .    33.0439
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him .    63.1194
But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized .    73.6042
And what sort of young lady is she ?    52.6038
At that moment , she cared for no other .    43.6478
And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment .    46.9738
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great .    15.4344
You have employed your time much better .    99.7779
" And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice .    34.7951
And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty .    30.9093
" What you ask , " said Elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr . Darcy had much better finish his letter . "    16.7350
He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him .    50.9437
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! - - What do you think has happened this morning ? - -    28.6411
Mr .    1.0050
" I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball .    29.4494
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas .    56.6722
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .    47.2538
She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits .    31.7299
" What do you think ?    14.5140
In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .    39.4042
You mentioned two instances .    355.3307
He then asked her to walk into the house - - but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .    26.1724
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady's fair , flowing hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages .    51.0961
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . "    47.8582
She put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality - - deliberated on the probability of each statement - - but with little success .    48.2135
Mr . Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House .    33.3670
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path .    24.5762
Oh , brother , how kind you are !    106.3636
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written    49.3052
to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .    88.9753
When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure .    30.3799
Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge .    71.5554
" He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle .    26.1605
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr . Bennet's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner .    30.5412
" She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property . "    46.1614
The day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres .    36.7004
But now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err .    70.6729
They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .    28.5328
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London .    25.7506
Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing .    34.8148
Could there be finer symptoms ?    290.7833
You blamed me for coming ? "    35.2225
Oh , that I knew how it was ! "    20.5113
How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family !    46.7491
I must have employment and society .    78.1485
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " Oh !    37.7133
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . "    61.6488
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother's in sending it .    82.0283
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton !    50.6098
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child .    74.4149
But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .    37.2826
Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .    40.2633
Mr . Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last Mr . Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .    40.2260
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement .    77.8460
" Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you .    68.3301
She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door .    46.0754
His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire .    38.9199
" You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . - - Are you much acquainted with Mr .    39.2867
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs . Bingley and talked of Mrs . Darcy may be guessed .    48.7250
At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .    30.7065
Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled !    54.4628
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand .    133.5622
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said , " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month .    35.5595
Every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .    25.0301
She was gone directly .    42.0106
Lord !    3.5221
In spite of having been at St . James's , Sir William was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter    31.9460
, frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .    44.9007
Did she call to refuse her consent ? "    72.7525
No , never .    205.7311
" I shall be very fit to see Jane - - which is all I want . "    23.9930
Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing - room .    22.7077
" Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use .    52.9718
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .    91.3721
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .    57.7057
She received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced    43.2105
him to her notice .    49.8751
He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company .    37.0709
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent .    35.8885
How shall we punish him for such a speech ? "    32.6974
" With the officers ! "    30.8555
The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .    48.4623
You may depend upon my seeking no further . "    38.5136
Mrs . Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs . Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton .    36.5356
Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then .    61.9934
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory .    40.8054
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . "    75.3091
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her    35.1925
, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .    58.6377
I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . "    33.3018
But your family owe me nothing .    98.0566
Then turning to Mr . Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon .    37.3385
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he    61.8062
was at the same time exercising great self - denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .    46.0922
" I am sick of Mr . Bingley , " cried his wife .    9.9862
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the <NUMBER> per cents .    39.7911
She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley .    32.4611
" If one could but go to Brighton ! "    76.0646
If you love Mr . Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .    19.3285
" Yes , " thought Elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once .    28.7361
cried Bingley .    17.6449
I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . "    35.0240
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying - - and from that , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . "    32.8281
She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung .    27.6400
However little Mr . Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , - - no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .    55.5225
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes .    47.9399
" This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , - - splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage .    67.7395
" So much the better .    67.4031
" La !    43.7833
He was full of joy and attention .    52.4684
In talking over their route the evening before , Mrs . Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .    35.3783
She had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge .    31.9171
Let me hear what it is . "    7.9989
It was in the Times and the Courier , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be .    36.9371
Mr . Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a    51.2186
wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread - bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker .    41.0007
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the - - - - shire militia removed from Meryton ?    34.4203
and his sisters are charming women .    78.2823
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley ,    25.4649
before they left the country .    13.4486
After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . "    30.2259
At last it arrested her - - and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr . Darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her .    28.2709
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .    34.1712
Mr . Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July , and must be in London again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they    54.1886
had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the Lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward    53.3970
than Derbyshire .    91.3403
But it is of small importance . "    31.0175
I came to try you .    71.0611
Mr . Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think    32.2825
tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !    46.1118
" Oh yes ! - - They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . "    77.5280
After tea , Mr . Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument .    21.1063
And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead .    78.1425
" My dear Friend , " If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day's t te - - t te    31.1852
between two women can never end without a quarrel .    94.2037
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! "    42.5562
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . "    54.2163
" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! - - How much I shall have to tell ! "    48.6660
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others .    32.3271
" I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley .    35.4375
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .    42.4075
I cannot quite agree with you there .    65.1131
You promised me to insist upon her marrying him . "    34.9162
In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . "    35.6642
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book .    58.4384
And then we were so merry all the way home !    92.2536
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family .    55.0537
They entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent .    51.8228
Sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before .    51.4464
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility .    40.9400
said she , as she looked in her face .    13.7950
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care    29.5336
not how much I may be wounding your's .    53.0790
" And how impossible in others ! "    123.9121
His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them .    36.9858
Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ?    75.6962
Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . "    68.5160
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them .    37.1003
Darcy said very little , and Mr . Hurst nothing at all .    27.5167
At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave .    39.6131
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely .    64.4031
Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor . "    39.5038
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents .    47.0503
Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs . Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair .    43.3752
" It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said Bingley .    29.9305
If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once .    63.1046
" Let me write for you , " said Jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . "    16.4042
She saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown .    82.9500
" But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . "    44.0697
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her .    39.9768
At length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready .    31.1509
A few weeks , he believed .    46.0389
I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .    40.5921
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune .    36.3660
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy .    63.7136
" If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you .    25.3067
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return .    104.1068
Had the late Mr . Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him I believe very early in life .    51.1754
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .    47.3888
" Very , very much .    45.5412
Mr . Collins was eloquent in her praise .    17.6902
Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating .    64.7584
It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution . "    30.0484
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds .    20.1470
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr . Darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings , where they were    48.1007
engaged to drink tea .    25.4137
Mrs . Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer .    31.1864
Let me mend it for you .    32.0478
His revenge would have been complete indeed .    43.6869
" I did not know before , " continued Bingley immediately , " that you were a studier of character .    28.1372
no - - it is not for me to be driven away by Mr . Darcy .    15.6989
" Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia's side , but nothing to give him any alarm .    50.6707
" Elizabeth , you are not serious now . "    23.6769
On Saturday he came again .    57.3713
" Well , then , you need not be under any alarm .    35.4138
The girls stared at their father .    38.5796
But that is nothing to us .    21.7371
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ?    52.2138
" Yes - - if Darcy does not put it off again .    35.0892
For , though your accusations were ill - founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof .    59.6502
Mr . Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister .    33.3002
" Can you come to - morrow ? "    26.7661
Unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only child ) I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and    114.1433
overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own .    48.1361
" Has she been presented ?    171.6992
How wonderfully these sort of things occur !    209.7221
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say .    51.6451
" We are not in a way to know what Mr . Bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit . "    18.5245
" Is that his design in settling here ? "    80.9864
Though her manner varied however , her determination never did .    136.5794
" I will not be interrupted .    15.0560
" She is so fond of Mrs . Forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away !    18.0390
" Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character    30.2073
for a twelvemonth .    25.6136
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little .    158.1418
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short lease . "    31.5584
Mrs . Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour ,    33.8763
were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .    49.3628
My child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life .    47.1579
When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr . Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance    42.7945
in his friend's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr . Bingley for his sister .    35.8236
On entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .    41.5519
" I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled .    41.8211
It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has never seen the view . "    18.2705
" Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? "    72.1594
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he wants you in the library . "    26.3401
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections .    77.5972
We must not make him desperate . "    14.2396
With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .    24.5649
" Perhaps that is not possible for any one .    41.6316
They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been    31.8527
in the way of procuring .    33.3195
" Oh !    5.3941
cried Miss Bingley , " Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable .    39.1113
He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again .    12.2958
" Undoubtedly , " replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation .    40.0845
The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your's . - - Do you draw ? "    41.4170
Bingley . "    6.4453
No one but Mrs . Bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home .    31.1913
I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind .    50.1429
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .    34.5764
" That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me . "    33.5395
" The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies    46.8843
. "    1.0279
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . "    38.9997
But , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined .    34.2503
You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us .    61.6622
" You begin to comprehend me , do you ? "    31.2088
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . "    31.7398
there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day .    41.4741
This invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married .    41.3865
" Oh !    5.3941
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced .    37.6590
what has she to do with it ?    110.4802
" You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty .    44.4938
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner .    46.8770
Darcy ? "    8.1311
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it .    44.4043
" I began to be afraid you would never come back again .    38.2766
" You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . "    44.1569
Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs . Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her    38.3843
towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast - room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .    62.5903
" She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind .    56.4775
Elizabeth could not help saying , " It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . "    15.4921
But of course she did not mention my name to you . "    25.1795
But her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent .    30.5438
They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him .    34.7580
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr . Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly    50.2992
.    N/A
" Yes , she called yesterday with her father .    33.4434
" I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a - year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . "    65.3442
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend .    42.5706
She knew not what to think , nor how to account for it .    52.9443
" That is to say , you had given your permission .    42.6136
" Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . "    30.7593
After a short silence , the lady first spoke .    46.5641
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . "    52.3631
He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible .    44.7913
After a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .    54.3820
But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .    21.1267
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen .    72.7600
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose .    39.3783
I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together .    44.3125
He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us .    27.4643
He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , " My dear    37.6993
Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? - - Mr .    30.8456
It became her turn to listen .    150.5556
He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again .    28.7656
She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that    23.4090
it did not contain a denial .    35.9402
I dare say I shall soon see them here . "    24.3100
" Very much . "    19.5919
And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage together .    59.6884
In her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin .    45.4849
Oh !    1.4661
" I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved - - shocked .    24.9439
" My dear Mr . Bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome !    11.4425
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman - like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way .    34.8925
" I had much rather go in the coach . "    45.2666
They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited .    55.6823
I am not at all afraid of her dying .    21.1571
To be sure , you knew no actual good of me - - but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . "    39.6167
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . "    31.0004
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident .    78.6102
In short , I will do my best . "    42.0136
When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were .    53.8049
" He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only . "    40.4321
and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . "    34.7975
" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's . "    24.2604
It adds even another motive .    412.6399
He did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately .    48.5076
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression .    66.7724
If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .    49.4438
If you'll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight .    70.4727
They had long wished to see him .    24.3146
" Read it aloud , " said their father , " for I hardly know myself what it is about . "    23.2400
Affectation of candour is common enough ; - - one meets it every where .    104.4224
But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a rival of Jane .    20.8223
I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes .    47.7222
" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr . Bingley , " said her mother , " I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Mr . Bennet's manor .    20.3770
" Good gracious !    29.8037
I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world .    14.6981
" You used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs . Hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . "    40.6074
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility .    65.3233
Mrs . Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere .    31.9752
Mrs . Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world .    42.3429
Mrs . Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man ,    33.7944
on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a - year .    54.6102
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought .    52.3220
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ?    94.3289
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .    40.0356
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .    58.5930
When coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument .    39.2893
As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth .    54.2740
Her hair so untidy , so blowsy ! "    43.6451
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . "    68.3965
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us .    133.7819
" No - - I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . "    19.9639
" I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Sir .    40.2743
" Certainly not ; at first .    124.3835
At such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . "    41.3997
" About a month , " said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . "    32.3143
A most welcome negative followed the last question - - and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied    37.3107
to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .    62.7961
But , perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .    40.1969
" Oh ! - - you mean Jane , I suppose - - because he danced with her twice .    21.4770
Anxiety on Jane's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr . Darcy's explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost .    52.2102
When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed .    22.0625
From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend over the    46.1977
house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help .    53.7312
As they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen .    91.6598
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw .    128.7995
There is nothing he would not do for her . "    13.5586
Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? "    54.2193
" Aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and Mrs . Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . "    20.4267
Never , since reading Jane's second letter , had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her .    66.5069
He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " That will do extremely well , child .    72.2429
Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner smiled .    11.9519
" Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance .    12.3511
On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , " Let me call    35.4382
your maid .    117.8621
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved .    48.9296
" It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty .    15.1920
" I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship .    44.1274
" And this is your real opinion !    46.0137
" Of what are you talking ? "    35.4436
This was not very consoling to Mrs . Bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate .    25.0502
" You shall hear then - - but prepare yourself for something very dreadful .    79.2098
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected .    41.3677
His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind .    39.0144
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr . Darcy had been over - rated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs . Gardiner's long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed    58.3011
to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : " I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory ,    35.5947
detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write .    42.3476
Who should suffer but myself ?    188.8031
At length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs . Reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . "    26.1526
" And do you really know all this ? "    25.7401
On their being joined by Mr . Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr . Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just    48.3509
been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .    21.5421
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . "    20.2534
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her .    92.7980
She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " By the bye , Charles ,    44.6741
are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? - - I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would    65.2728
be rather a punishment than a pleasure . "    52.6133
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up .    55.4010
Mr . Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . "    26.2745
But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your    54.2787
letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due .    66.0948
" You quite mistook Mr . Darcy .    31.2985
She wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise .    42.5252
" What can be the meaning of this ! "    15.6028
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . "    27.0000
" How strange ! "    10.4912
Your mother insists upon your accepting it .    107.4205
She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse .    25.9391
That is all settled . "    13.0799
" You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; - - if the first , I should be    67.2775
completely in your way ; - - and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . "    30.4143
" I believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied Wickham ; " I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .    27.6159
Is not it so , Mrs .    40.2088
We will go round the Park every day .    39.1197
His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . Darcy's sister , as , by Wickham's account , she would make him abundantly    37.2119
regret what he had thrown away .    19.7797
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes .    34.6167
Now is your time .    45.8462
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard - heartedness in any of the family .    42.5632
I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . "    31.9717
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place .    75.1620
" My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? "    14.7857
" He is also handsome , " replied Elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can .    24.0180
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs . Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone .    38.5962
At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted - - - - " He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each other .    26.0142
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her .    17.3393
said her aunt .    19.0335
Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman - like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education .    38.5813
Does he know his real character ? "    54.9236
Where shall you change horses ? - - Oh !    25.8939
" You need not distress yourself .    60.6453
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good .    96.4339
The business was therefore soon settled .    58.1346
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured .    49.8211
The loss of her daughter made Mrs . Bennet very dull for several days .    40.2447
He repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence .    52.2242
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? "    250.7116
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day .    21.9463
He spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride .    50.1301
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .    59.7302
" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . "    13.9394
She attracted him more than he liked - - and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself .    30.0617
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct .    27.7788
Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . - - But no , " - - recollecting herself , - - " that could never be : my    39.5540
uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : I should not have been allowed to invite them . "    15.1425
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me .    46.1416
" His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said Elizabeth angrily ; " for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr . Darcy's steward , and of that , I can assure    34.4369
you , he informed me himself . "    59.4488
In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels .    96.1368
By this time she is actually with them !    32.7222
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing - room .    28.9160
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road .    34.4899
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts .    79.5378
" Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings .    63.9627
If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient .    18.3502
Mr . Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr . Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .    35.8390
But you are always giving her the preference . "    76.7254
Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . "    25.5057
" My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour .    31.8007
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place .    46.9857
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention .    56.1561
" What is his name ? "    21.1675
You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr . Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in    48.7759
my behalf .    194.3547
thought she .    223.9731
You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner .    38.5528
Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; - - but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .    44.3721
" I am astonished , " said Miss Bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books . - - What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr .    26.7306
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined .    31.5936
His character was decided .    22.6787
Mrs . Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it .    15.9386
It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .    26.9226
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .    49.6991
Its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned .    132.7467
" In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . "    47.7976
" Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . "    21.5175
" If you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone .    21.4228
That he was surprised by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr . Gardiner .    36.6174
Charlotte the wife of Mr . Collins , was a most humiliating picture ! - - And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the    37.1395
lot she had chosen .    53.9553
cried he .    63.3694
She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .    70.1514
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but Mrs . Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it    30.0878
may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough .    100.2707
A person may be proud without being vain .    59.1074
" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter .    40.7647
Mr . Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was Saturday .    24.5339
I had not believed it possible . "    25.5385
Have you seen any pleasant men ?    210.6534
Your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . "    45.1370
Mr . Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment .    29.2467
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton , he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her    46.7425
time had passed at Hunsford , she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr . Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former .    52.8385
" I do not know . - - I hope there was . - - But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult .    18.1169
We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her .    48.7957
"    N/A
" Do not you want to know who has taken it ? "    30.0478
They could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same .    25.7779
" Oh !    5.3941
It is admirable ! "    24.0571
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any    37.2197
notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . - - Mr .    21.7014
cried Elizabeth .    4.2699
Lady Catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . Darcy .    33.2656
She then took a large house in Edward - street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings .    44.4752
" And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? "    27.1811
" What would she have said ? - - how would she have behaved ? "    38.1517
Mr . Darcy replied with great intrepidity , " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . "    13.9675
Mr . Philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before .    62.9690
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him .    24.4217
It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you .    30.2929
They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .    18.6005
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected .    46.5335
" There is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said Kitty ; " who can it be ? "    18.8382
Do not let us quarrel about the past .    35.2016
" My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts .    32.1178
The path just admitted three .    505.1671
" Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , " said her father ; " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully .    26.0088
They travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner - time the next day .    37.0637
Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? "    32.1885
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour .    40.4153
People do not die of little trifling colds .    31.5039
" And I certainly never shall give it .    29.0488
She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty .    28.4178
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts .    46.9459
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her .    18.2023
" Can I have the carriage ? "    25.1319
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? "    54.2539
Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven !    132.6290
It is from my cousin , Mr . Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . "    22.0636
Elizabeth's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as Miss Bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to Wickham , Georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .    65.7543
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . "    43.8238
Oh !    1.4661
On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away .    28.7135
It was as follows : " MY DEAR SIR , " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a    55.3945
letter from Hertfordshire .    56.3090
The same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening .    53.0720
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .    73.9252
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that I despair .    38.0394
It was to be such a secret ! "    22.4384
A clergyman like you must marry . - - Chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a    67.9039
good way .    36.9793
He is come - - Mr . Bingley is come . - - He is , indeed .    17.1893
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible .    63.5750
But if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs . Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it    46.0993
on myself . "    26.8627
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply .    29.1946
" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! "    51.9954
Not handsome enough to dance with !    148.9324
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's .    49.3823
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications .    65.7180
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case .    18.8556
" Mr .    22.1231
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure .    35.3330
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? "    58.9255
Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from P . I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park .    32.8701
" Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word . "    39.2864
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune .    49.4012
The horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them .    42.9450
" His pride , " said Miss Lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .    27.2386
here comes Hill .    153.6472
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon .    76.5058
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . "    44.4830
She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak .    49.9544
Mr . Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .    57.2042
cried Elizabeth ; " but how could that be ? - - How could his will be disregarded ? - - Why did not you seek legal redress ? "    47.0915
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .    53.4944
Till this moment , I never knew myself . "    20.1753
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret .    54.7976
His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time .    64.7449
But there are two things that I want very much to know : - - one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . "    47.2012
This preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty - seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .    37.2540
Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief .    28.7088
What are men to rocks and mountains ?    137.6516
Too much , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ?    47.5106
Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .    36.7078
Sir William had been delighted with him .    12.2224
" Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam .    19.1679
" When I am in the country , " he replied , " I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same .    19.7077
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner .    46.6982
" Well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " I have no more to say .    11.8588
Mr . Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless .    38.2219
Mrs . Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments .    18.9696
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly . - - Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome .    59.3634
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even Bingley's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk    52.2751
of giving them a hint to be gone .    29.4502
The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long    57.6946
before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her .    27.0640
" What do you mean , Hill ?    20.1732
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes .    47.7405
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe .    57.4668
Kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry .    60.2813
So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . "    30.2076
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her .    34.9952
As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner .    31.2180
I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely .    45.7859
" You are a good girl ; " he replied , " and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .    17.3888
how shall I bear so much happiness ! "    59.4827
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine .    51.9744
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .    39.6511
If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better .    17.7600
She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . "    24.4117
There was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects .    27.7542
Mrs . Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not .    48.0328
Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better .    31.0110
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship's indignation would have been .    45.7884
Hear me in silence .    20.2865
Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice .    80.1902
You tear them to pieces . "    36.4124
It was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ; - - and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .    39.3325
" You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr .    15.6906
You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude .    39.6931
His most particular friend , you see by Jane's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her .    56.1058
Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth .    20.8724
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way .    35.7041
Mrs . Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card .    31.7100
Every body is disgusted with his pride .    20.2704
He smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things .    88.9344
She dreaded seeing Wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible .    23.4988
" Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ?    23.4578
" Which do you mean ? "    14.0947
Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive .    50.5577
Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs .    40.8054
" I hope not so .    69.8415
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . "    25.2531
Such doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly .    109.4534
We now come to the point .    50.8343
Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .    55.1490
" All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . "    61.2048
I will read it to you - - " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the    45.8687
same time convinced that when Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel .    50.4201
But on returning to the drawing - room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her .    28.1205
I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you . "    36.4201
His plan did not vary on seeing them . - - Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice .    53.1827
But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs . Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise . "    37.0065
When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , openly ,    53.5812
and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr .    78.2952
As they passed through the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining - parlour and drawing - room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on .    24.2601
" He is indeed - - but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? "    43.0634
In a few days Mr . Bingley returned Mr . Bennet's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library .    21.9449
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all .    52.8024
Darcy ? "    8.1311
Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and was opened immediately .    36.8607
I dare say the lace upon Mrs . Hurst's gown - - - - " Here she was interrupted again .    30.4800
His words seemed to imply it .    49.8470
If I could but see you as happy !    58.8910
" My dear , " replied her husband , " I have two small favours to request .    25.8615
She shook her head .    14.2675
yes .    7.8297
" Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs . Bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way . - - But I tell you what    35.0041
, Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all - - and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father    33.8922
is dead . - - I shall not be able to keep you - - and so I warn you . - - I have done with you from this very day . - - I told you in the library , you know , that I should never    17.2222
speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .    25.8903
I mend pens remarkably well . "    59.1170
The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention .    67.1262
were questions with which she amused herself .    49.3009
Why was he to be the judge ? "    77.3013
I felt a little uneasy - - a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right .    36.7250
" Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had .    58.6057
At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction .    93.2532
" You have only proved by this , " cried Elizabeth , " that Mr . Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .    18.7615
My sisters may write to me .    40.8220
" That is his notion of christian forgiveness !    83.7155
Why should they try to influence him ?    96.9614
He would scarcely be ten pounds a - year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother's hands ,    53.7863
Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum .    72.5333
Jane then took it from her pocket - book , and gave it to Elizabeth .    50.1405
They were in - - - - street .    17.1394
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much .    76.3224
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs . Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed .    34.6489
By Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .    31.3409
Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life !    45.0975
I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company .    60.6575
One must speak a little , you know .    30.5866
At such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward .    39.3551
" Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . "    29.9516
Mr . Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would    36.7735
naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character .    42.1388
" We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said Jane : " I hope and trust they will yet be happy .    35.9557
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !    49.6001
A small sum could not do all this . "    38.8614
" Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks .    19.7224
Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .    18.4297
And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it .    28.5572
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone . "    35.0636
" Did Charlotte dine with you ? "    42.3687
" I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear    48.6440
that the performance would reflect no credit on either . "    79.3317
It was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them .    32.6665
Don't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side .    37.2482
" Oh !    5.3941
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business .    29.7213
Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step .    39.8692
Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .    42.3247
Mr . Collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels . - - Kitty    39.3533
stared at him , and Lydia exclaimed . - - Other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons .    47.0850
If she does not object to it , why should we ? "    42.4298
Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ?    38.2190
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .    39.3590
It seemed like wilful ill - nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her .    63.1841
But vanity , not love , has been my folly . - - Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away ,    44.7250
where either were concerned .    124.0825
I must speak to Hill , this moment . "    29.1216
" Oh ! "    3.3249
" Lady Catherine de Bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living .    25.6254
" It must not be thought of .    57.9416
Well , how pleased I am !    70.9680
I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . "    21.1550
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name .    33.8871
Your sister I also watched . - - Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did    54.1988
not invite them by any participation of sentiment . - - If you have not been mistaken here , I must have been in an error .    27.8537
Their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast - room .    17.8443
" You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing .    35.0048
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side .    48.9617
Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can , - - or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty runs away . "    41.3111
" DEAR SIR , " I must trouble you once more for congratulations .    64.4855
" A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh .    32.9695
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ?    28.9661
But perhaps Mr . Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . "    27.9721
If there were but such another man for you ! "    101.8950
Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! "    60.6946
As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .    35.9538
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery .    52.8472
Oh !    1.4661
There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again .    65.7725
" Oh , yes .    19.4997
She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " Oh !    32.4022
" True .    36.5120
" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he .    23.2719
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .    29.3432
Not that I think Charlotte so very plain - - but then she is our particular friend . "    37.3904
" It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . "    38.6843
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr . Darcy's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture .    36.8648
Her astonishment at his coming - - at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire .    44.0750
I told my sister Philips so the other day .    73.8949
I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say .    38.5986
Mrs . Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them ,    31.6839
she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones's shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility    38.5738
was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane's introduction of him .    63.5882
He then said , " I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly .    38.9872
" Mrs . Collins , you must send a servant with them .    29.7275
" He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .    33.4661
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . "    46.8587
" That is very true , " replied Elizabeth , " and I could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . "    16.7468
" Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! "    36.3124
He drew a chair near her .    65.0983
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard .    33.7519
What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to - morrow evening .    37.4040
good or bad ? "    173.5537
In a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account .    32.0951
And when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing .    35.9403
" We have heard only once .    66.4379
And she rose as she spoke .    39.3869
Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . "    25.9971
At present we have nothing to guide us .    38.7289
" But the wife of Mr . Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . "    38.5111
" You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged .    60.8675
Indeed he has no improper pride .    50.7495
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday .    104.1530
I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . "    26.5851
But , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise .    48.2641
Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " - - and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .    30.5449
It cannot be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .    44.4243
Mrs . Hurst thought the same , and added , " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker .    35.9770
The party did not supply much conversation .    67.4563
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . "    47.5168
How can they suit each other ? - - Do you know Mr .    21.0463
Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield .    44.5224
But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company .    53.7400
Mr . Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr . Bingley never stirs without    46.3725
him . "    7.9921
Every thing nourishes what is strong already .    105.5697
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . "    70.7273
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London .    25.8379
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! "    43.9629
" Yes , very well .    17.5889
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . "    44.5895
" Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , " said Elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . "    33.9732
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .    46.0391
But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! - - They were excessively sorry to go !    29.4223
But do not imagine that he is always here so often .    30.2190
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in    54.8623
unison with her opinion of each .    22.8686
The very last evening was spent there ; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that    56.8849
Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh .    53.5305
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked .    85.9915
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . "    39.2792
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in the scheme , every part of    46.1880
it would have been perfect .    24.7139
cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , " I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner .    40.4848
" I must ask whether you were surprised ? "    33.1950
You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared !    46.6771
Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that    26.5727
Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .    24.9336
- - And upon Elizabeth's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " Lizzy , I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr .    86.1530
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished .    52.0589
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce    42.1481
.    N/A
Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . "    28.6951
" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself .    57.4418
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves .    107.8240
They are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines .    69.3292
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to you .    31.0781
The t te - - t te surprised them .    35.0887
" And what arts did he use to separate them ? "    65.4583
The rector of a parish has much to do . - - In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron .    48.3148
But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of    58.6401
circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain .    78.1571
" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? "    45.0322
she added , " by far too much .    32.5206
It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it .    45.1324
Lady Catherine seemed resigned .    22.6021
They will never be distressed for money .    33.1489
When I last saw her , she was not very promising .    33.5765
" Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you .    38.2266
She had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr . Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of    46.3899
the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows . "    68.2891
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments    38.8374
avowed , however unequally they may be returned .    124.4056
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs . Annesley    66.7585
to Miss Darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .    37.1428
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before .    37.8728
" I am far from attributing any part of Mr . Bingley's conduct to design , " said Elizabeth ; " but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .    36.5600
Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr . Darcy's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to    36.9811
him , though George Wickham has treated Mr . Darcy in a most infamous manner .    48.5885
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! - - I never heard of such a thing .    26.3858
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful .    30.7898
He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman's daughter ; so far we are equal . "    43.0223
Let her go then .    263.3619
Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all !    77.0900
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure .    79.2149
Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice .    36.5141
" Nor I , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley .    11.9922
This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming .    47.3018
But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done .    17.4334
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners .    45.5327
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house .    55.0633
" Mr . Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . "    33.8807
They were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them .    28.6420
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married    46.2630
.    N/A
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . "    50.7638
But let me advise you to think better of it .    25.6944
" And Mary King is safe ! "    77.3233
" Oh , yes !    15.5466
how unlucky !    76.7898
" But surely , " said she , " I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . "    33.0331
She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself .    45.2801
You see on what a footing we are .    130.3792
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .    38.3765
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane .    21.6268
" It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . "    28.9000
His appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address .    39.2607
It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions .    40.1395
" I have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .    28.9598
In Lydia's imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness .    64.8134
" Could I expect it to be otherwise ! "    35.9366
They are gone off together from Brighton .    48.4315
observed Mrs . Bennet .    11.7948
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr . Bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .    51.0125
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not .    35.1158
Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . "    28.3742
it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr . Collins's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness .    25.6066
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence .    46.9252
" Excuse my interference . - - It was kindly meant . "    32.2560
" You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course .    28.2439
It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . "    53.8764
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above - mentioned ; and while Mr . Darcy was attending them to their carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person , behaviour , and dress .    69.1930
" You mistake me , my dear .    24.9094
Thank Heaven !    29.6002
We have heard nothing from town . "    17.3369
" True .    36.5119
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting .    46.0272
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . "    35.4607
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .    53.6676
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment    46.1056
, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her - - their opinion of every body - - would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to    36.2543
him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing .    70.3589
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs . Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " Lord , how tired I am ! "    60.5784
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest .    87.7358
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? "    19.1844
" That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask .    44.1274
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . "    29.1283
It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else .    72.9025
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father .    43.6076
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings .    70.8615
" But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune . "    68.1946
The second began .    169.9613
" Thank you , " said Lydia , " for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . "    25.9684
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !    47.8414
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name .    40.4205
" Another time , Lizzy , " said her mother , " I would not dance with him , if I were you . "    12.4696
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care .    38.6112
" The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .    32.0192
Ten thousand a year , and very likely more !    28.7235
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them .    49.4347
When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs . Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr . Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating    37.1865
a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation .    51.8941
He has heartily forgiven me now . "    64.8891
" Indeed , Mr . Bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in    20.1465
it ! "    26.9714
" Oh , lord !    17.8593
She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth .    37.3882
" They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . "    27.8676
When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn .    22.1427
He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr . Darcy had been staying there .    47.5390
Very odd ! - - And you only the second . - - The younger ones out before the elder are married ! - - Your younger sisters must be very young ? "    28.9769
cried Jane , " what do you mean , Sir ? "    12.9512
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it .    24.0721
We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home .    61.0139
Her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to Elizabeth's wishes , for she was impatient to get home .    31.1318
" She is my youngest girl but one .    68.6453
They were ignorant , idle , and vain .    33.3305
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr . Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem .    28.0037
The venison was roasted to a turn - - and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch .    50.4423
She dared not even mention that gentleman .    72.6054
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr . Darcy returned within the stated time .    46.5076
" Ah ! "    8.2853
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs . Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected .    41.8590
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs . Bennet's ill humour or ill health .    62.3857
It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .    29.3907
Have a little compassion on my nerves .    31.8442
She was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they took place .    47.4276
" I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression .    47.7079
Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which    41.1311
he thought himself obliged to accept .    57.5507
" Perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister .    24.6624
Mr . Darcy's letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart .    50.3389
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit .    36.8480
It would have suited me in every respect . "    24.5461
My temper would perhaps be called resentful . - - My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . "    53.7645
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way .    57.7316
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family .    37.1626
- - cried Elizabeth .    14.3475
" Well , so much the better .    17.5525
Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair . "    178.7092
Elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .    63.2434
I do not wish to avoid the walk .    26.2640
said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone .    11.1968
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed .    83.8853
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged .    65.6906
I appeal to Mr . Darcy : - - but let me not interrupt you , Sir . - - You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . "    28.8881
I wish I could see her .    40.6211
Your's , & c . " Mr . Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in reply to his last .    24.6524
" I am trying to make it out . "    14.5655
Its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .    32.1462
His surprise was great .    61.3956
" Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? "    50.0467
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects .    37.3698
For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him .    33.2198
They must be a great loss to your family . "    13.2298
" It is not Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . "    11.2889
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her .    46.0328
Darcy made no answer .    6.4360
" Indeed I had .    80.6942
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme .    35.4962
She studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .    65.5179
" Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? "    38.2852
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but Mrs . Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage .    44.8815
" I am sure , " said she , " I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away .    21.7702
" There can be no doubt of that .    32.9706
Her father lifted up his eyes .    29.0237
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . "    37.7257
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home .    27.2155
I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . "    32.9037
You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . "    41.3803
You must learn some of my philosophy .    50.2207
I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . "    42.0863
cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; " and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . "    33.0367
cried he , turning towards her .    28.9235
Let me hear from you very soon .    38.8138
" Well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy .    12.8555
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together .    43.1568
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . "    41.6315
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr .    27.4798
Well !    91.6183
" Are you , indeed ?    22.2895
" Though it is difficult , " said Jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . "    42.0904
Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent .    42.0839
When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last    42.1892
finish .    133.0900
" No , no .    61.9739
You are a gentleman's daughter .    36.3834
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to    47.9397
be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true !    107.2771
As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . "    29.7291
His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain !    62.7126
Mr . Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep .    55.2839
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . "    12.7101
Poor Lydia's situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful .    55.0625
Poor little Lizzy !    61.4832
and his answering immediately to the last question - - Oh !    65.1303
" Oh !    5.3941
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world ,    35.5268
he was caught by their easy playfulness .    65.9050
" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent .    46.1738
Bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter .    34.9111
The period of expectation was now doubled .    88.1028
I guessed as much . "    38.7603
He was well , but so much engaged with Mr . Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him .    21.7725
Well , any friend of Mr . Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . "    37.7189
There was no want of discourse .    30.5992
But her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton , these visitors came .    63.7461
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came , and Mrs . Bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth    38.9721
.    N/A
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr . Collins's side , and as many bows on Sir William's , they departed .    31.8065
Younger sons cannot marry where they like . "    95.0155
" But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? "    42.4190
With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did Lydia , assisted by Kitty's hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn .    49.7739
" Miss Bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be .    18.5657
She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne's .    37.1076
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you .    23.0952
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again .    28.5909
Mr . Darcy , who was leaning against the mantle - piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise .    30.9116
I was uncomfortable enough .    142.8877
The strangeness of Mr . Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .    43.1021
" But I can assure you , " she added , " that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing .    36.8636
Her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank .    58.4646
Mrs . Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .    44.9442
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . "    29.4782
Well , much good may it do them !    189.2918
It was a journey of only twenty - four miles , and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch - street by noon .    50.3143
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .    64.5922
But there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure .    66.1722
But at length , by Elizabeth's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or    30.8510
her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt    29.8082
from the city .    230.7480
But I knew I should persuade you at last .    34.1966
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . "    27.7655
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . "    25.7454
" You are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . "    17.3383
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character .    47.7281
I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage . "    24.8669
During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening .    23.5711
- - And then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .    28.2822
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement ,    50.5845
but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . "    107.3246
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood - - the sort of preference which was often given me . "    35.8977
I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh .    81.8168
Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . "    29.6263
sir , I do indeed .    20.8506
" I have heard from authority , which I thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . "    40.0685
He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us .    45.5454
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .    66.1089
Darcy was fixed in astonishment .    85.5342
Mr . Darcy , you cannot deny the fact . "    17.9959
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl . - - Oh !    34.8006
Her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines .    86.0305
Wretched , wretched , mistake ! "    43.2627
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week ; and even Mr . Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least .    40.9115
He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . "    31.7499
" Impossible , Mr . Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? "    25.9882
This letter is from Mr .    34.2731
" You did !    84.5460
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother .    48.4266
Anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing - room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil .    29.6394
To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .    22.8397
" Lizzy , " said he , " I was going to look for you ; come into my room . "    18.8703
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see .    44.0646
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds .    21.5453
You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . "    37.5952
The hall , the dining - room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs . Bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .    36.0263
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help .    59.8027
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in    30.6191
every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others .    40.5356
Mr . Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I    47.5158
did before . "    101.2301
or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ?    98.7411
Why , he has four or five thousand a - year , and very likely more . "    25.4197
" No , Lizzy , that is what I do not choose .    14.8515
" Yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " I remember hearing you once say , Mr . Darcy , that you hardly    32.2284
ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable .    71.0313
His countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue .    57.0001
" Oh !    5.3941
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it .    58.5370
" He brought it with him for us to see . "    65.2794
" Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? "    43.3140
The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .    44.3545
how can it affect them ? "    56.7658
She approached , and saw the likeness of Mr . Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle - piece .    48.6480
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame .    30.7189
He was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane's letter last Wednesday , that her    36.1720
conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain .    78.8010
Elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .    56.4126
" You must decide for yourself , " said Elizabeth , " and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him    35.6282
. "    1.0279
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected - - " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you    30.7295
would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . "    46.6354
Mrs . Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces .    39.3277
" There were some very strong objections against the lady , " were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London .    90.0307
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing    57.6048
would fail her .    209.3275
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . "    77.5324
" What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? "    34.0919
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . "    67.6338
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr .    69.5950
She resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family .    38.4693
It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now . "    48.2560
He seldom appeared really animated .    167.3497
" Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . "    50.4775
An union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family .    28.7394
Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . "    103.8995
She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .    51.2096
To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and    41.3816
whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley .    76.2031
He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .    54.9210
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . "    79.6736
And his behaviour , so strikingly altered , - - what could it mean ?    47.2964
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ; and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time .    39.2359
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield .    50.0351
They met several times , for there was much to be discussed .    46.9013
It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining .    34.7533
What will you think of my vanity ?    30.0650
My mother was in hysterics , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done !    24.5780
He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman - like man , asked her how she had liked him .    40.8288
But the case is this .    39.9020
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , "    56.5579
Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? - - Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? "    26.6313
As Mrs . Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet came from it .    22.2683
I am very , very sorry .    78.5059
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs . Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end    43.0379
in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .    41.3937
" My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , Eliza , " said Charlotte .    50.7781
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .    73.3246
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! )    96.0760
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than    42.9534
it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .    129.6948
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word .    26.9518
" My father and Maria are to come to me in March , " added Charlotte , " and I hope you will consent to be of the party .    30.7658
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other .    48.8146
" Oh !    5.3941
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am .    49.4999
" And then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself .    40.0005
" You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .    67.1111
She shall hear my opinion . "    33.2693
She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to - - she is lost for ever . "    50.7355
" It is wonderful , " - - replied Wickham , - - " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; - - and pride has often been his best friend .    44.4736
" From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as    50.1284
to form that ground - work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry    53.0445
. "    1.0279
Have not you always hated him ? "    27.7556
Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten .    50.8556
" You were Mr . Bingley's first choice . "    22.6717
" Whatever I do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes .    38.1544
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ?    131.5745
hang Kitty !    36.4075
" No , I believe not . "    14.6213
" You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . "    13.4059
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers .    64.9893
He was on one side of her mother .    24.2953
One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , " Lizzy , I never gave you an account of my wedding , I believe .    26.9642
Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away .    32.9306
" My dear , you flatter me .    19.8376
He still loves me , and we are engaged . "    25.9151
" I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while    55.6200
may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence .    97.2361
Her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness .    45.3301
It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . "    15.5316
Mr . Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house .    30.0224
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr . Bingley .    27.5795
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and    54.6745
composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .    24.2881
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .    57.9903
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter .    67.6576
Darcy . "    4.6843
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented .    64.8268
Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; - - she knew not how to believe that Mr . Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr . Bingley's regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable    24.0415
appearance as Wickham . - - The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and    44.8747
throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .    45.1759
At that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion .    75.4364
" I have heard much of your master's fine person , " said Mrs . Gardiner , looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face .    25.3792
You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . "    41.1411
As yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness .    36.6462
And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? "    63.7685
" My real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me .    39.1026
I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike them .    51.0763
" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . "    52.6864
It settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts .    37.2715
And one of my own daughters .    18.6690
" Now I have got some news for you , " said Lydia , as they sat down to table .    20.4181
" That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth .    13.2201
Mr . Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began    36.2514
.    N/A
His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .    60.7983
" Sure he will not leave London before he has found them .    47.0964
Mr . Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house .    30.1391
" You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . "    35.9395
" What do you mean ? "    7.2094
" Pride , " observed Mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing I believe .    45.8962
* * * * * Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .    9.5354
Society , I own , is necessary to me .    35.7568
She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . "    21.7039
" How despicably have I acted ! "    68.6078
People did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true .    31.9677
As a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship ! - - How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! - - How much of good or evil must be done by    31.4742
him !    161.9431
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly .    63.4759
They followed her into the dining - parlour .    16.2356
Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself .    33.2730
She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and    46.1472
directed all his anger against another .    29.9963
" I did not think Caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London .    33.6305
But we are all liable to error .    61.8097
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him ; they are even impartial towards Miss King .    81.6633
During dinner , Mr . Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very    33.9030
fortunate in his patroness .    35.4646
" Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! "    39.2705
but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " Is it in address that he improves ?    47.9326
You had much better dance . "    31.8102
" It is difficult indeed - - it is distressing . - - One does not know what to think . "    19.1298
But it was not to be .    11.4759
With no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . - - The envelope itself    68.4721
was likewise full . - - Pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .    59.6551
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing - room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr . Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her .    41.0688
He meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .    36.9622
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained .    100.7753
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion .    48.1469
" Is this , " thought Elizabeth , " meant for me ? "    25.0148
Not one party , or scheme , or any thing .    35.2273
Girls , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ?    28.3827
" I am afraid , Mr . Darcy , " observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . "    25.4104
" Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must disarm reproof . "    14.3826
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women .    72.2921
" If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins - - but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup    38.4300
enough I shall send round my cards . "    52.9749
" And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? "    42.7211
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half - hour's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment .    102.6490
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr . Wickham .    33.1107
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . "    78.8156
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away .    43.0529
You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it .    50.8526
My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr . Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and    43.9613
if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant .    63.8285
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish - - and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . - - Here you are in your own family . "    26.2732
Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment's deliberation , " I am not . "    31.7255
" And so was I . "    70.5910
After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr . Wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball .    42.8393
As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following manner : - - " You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither .    21.7716
" Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? "    27.7459
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it .    44.1570
It was very little less .    23.6145
A thousand things may arise in six months ! "    78.7645
I thought we never should have got into the coach .    32.9178
" That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had - - not turned out well .    64.5133
Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .    55.4631
" No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .    19.2079
You have sense , and we all expect you to use it .    58.3744
Mr . Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .    36.9999
Mamma would like to go too of all things !    112.6828
" Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .    68.9829
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , " I can guess the subject of your reverie . "    33.7175
Heaven forbid !    534.5950
If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this .    29.8066
" Don't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven's sake !    142.8357
They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it . "    31.6149
You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage .    60.9051
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .    46.7206
But now it was all too natural .    73.0754
Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them .    54.9152
* * * * * They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ; and Mrs . Bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour's visit    24.3930
, had revived .    374.8754
It was Mr . Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest .    44.5931
They saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry .    84.5921
Mr . Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane ; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs . Bennet .    28.1461
You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last .    37.2582
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? "    75.6164
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh .    28.8546
The first week of their return was soon gone .    46.1610
After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F . came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through    53.1087
.    N/A
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast .    71.5520
When they were all in the drawing - room , the questions which Elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give .    28.3775
" You look pale .    54.1206
" You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . "    28.8866
Darcy . "    4.6842
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night .    77.0789
" Already arisen ! "    111.5170
" Your's , & c . " This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least .    41.3028
" But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model .    48.4598
Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill .    50.6943
Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the - - - - shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . "    38.5108
I now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him .    48.1401
for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well .    37.5689
And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .    40.8638
It was gratitude . - - Gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .    50.1764
I shall now know how to act .    60.5990
What is to become of us !    126.0729
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much .    89.7537
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . "    38.0411
If I have wounded your sister's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them . - - With respect to that other , more weighty accusation ,    52.9377
of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family .    40.9486
She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .    36.7043
" I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with him I believe it does not often happen .    30.3396
Little more than half a day's journey .    44.0606
Hope was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort .    37.9690
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them .    53.8992
single , my dear , to be sure !    22.6099
On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of Jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention    65.2282
of her , had he dared .    73.7947
- - She could have added , " A young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " - - but she contented herself with " And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood ,    66.2333
connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! "    26.6152
And what sort of table do they keep ?    174.1853
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .    59.8000
Perhaps I am not doing her justice .    27.0422
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected .    48.8900
He had never had the slightest suspicion .    65.1146
But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair .    31.4600
Oh , Lord !    68.5678
You are lucky in having such a master . "    29.6816
" You are quite right .    21.4266
" No , " said Colonel Fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me .    17.7837
" I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .    17.2326
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr . Collins , and Mr . Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . "    19.9627
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . "    38.0852
Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay in Derbyshire , so often , and in    33.0315
so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .    60.6814
I have not the smallest hope .    23.3810
You know him too well to doubt the rest .    51.7589
I shall never forget her appearance this morning .    44.6092
" A man who had felt less , might . "    50.3461
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away .    59.3745
I was ready to die of laughter .    55.2544
Mrs . Bennet rang the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library .    16.6359
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters .    103.5955
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet .    31.0065
He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner .    50.8782
He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done .    46.2198
But what does he say of the living ? "    34.8325
on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford - - between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs . Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot - stool , that she said , ' Mr .    48.1820
You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . "    34.0486
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before .    96.7916
But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ?    50.3665
But against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered .    44.4157
This is the estimation in which you hold me !    42.9224
Their situation was awkward enough ; but her's she thought was still worse .    60.7008
But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet .    38.1918
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery .    127.1528
They are wanted in the farm , Mr . Bennet , are not they ? "    23.0709
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related .    50.6189
" Upon my word , Sir , " cried Elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration .    47.6126
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon .    58.1865
I will have no reserves from you . "    10.3712
An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! - - Imagine our    45.1481
surprise .    14.6140
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention .    40.5758
Mr . Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .    27.1777
The dejection was almost universal .    88.0673
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you !    39.0133
" To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone !    52.5000
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . "    34.2558
Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again .    61.2023
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill . " Lydia declared herself satisfied .    45.6198
Did you see him while you were at Lambton ?    29.8060
" Perhaps , " said Darcy , " I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . "    24.5292
They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a    23.2634
man whom nobody cared anything about .    229.0462
" How could you begin ? "    29.6430
" A gamester ! "    31.3308
It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn .    37.4007
He was always to have gone on Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay .    60.2811
Collins , you must marry .    28.7297
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance .    43.3003
" I am sure there is not on his .    24.5504
I will only add , God bless you .    125.9226
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate .    84.3252
She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .    39.6873
" No really , " replied Elizabeth ; " I think there cannot be too little said on the subject . "    20.2524
Pray write instantly , and let me understand it - - unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . "    41.1669
" I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , " said he .    67.0971
" It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill . " " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her brother - - " because he does    37.2114
not write with ease .    226.3978
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . "    32.5923
She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the    54.0794
sake of finding out that Mrs . Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family .    45.9105
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the - - - - shire , might be able to give more information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to .    23.9452
We were always good friends ; and now we are better . "    28.9241
She is almost three and twenty !    166.1357
He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .    49.5345
" I do not believe Mrs . Long will do any such thing .    23.9888
Her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .    87.4839
He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party .    41.9969
Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to - - - - You shall try it some day . - - Do your sisters play and sing ? "    61.0376
But he is an ugly fellow !    42.6527
" You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . "    49.7052
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous .    69.4304
" It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the - - - - shire .    27.0701
Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to Darcy , " Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master .    36.3586
No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind .    100.7464
" It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye - lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . "    38.7340
I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel .    37.0042
By many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , - - but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song .    60.4420
" Haye - Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off !    52.0077
" I do not recollect that we did . "    21.6144
" What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! "    23.6823
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? "    75.0004
Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself . "    23.2125
Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .    46.3608
Mr . Bennet's expectations were fully answered .    36.2224
The first part of Mrs . Gardiner's business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions .    39.2455
We had better go into the avenue . "    36.0996
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive    43.8627
herself no longer .    37.0855
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home .    48.9163
" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for    28.1941
one half hour . "    33.4117
Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the Boulanger - - - - " " If he had had any compassion    34.0034
for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much !    32.6448
I cannot find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl .    30.7984
Mr . Wickham's attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh .    28.5032
Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs . Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet .    45.5277
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . "    68.2689
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . "    23.0821
" Well , well , and so Mr . Bingley is coming down , sister , " ( for Mrs . Philips first brought her the news . )    60.3580
" Your examination of Mr . Darcy is over , I presume , " said Miss Bingley ; - - " and pray what is the result ? "    15.6041
They solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister .    60.5569
I think I have heard you say that you know them . "    19.8523
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , " I did not know before that you ever walked this way . "    47.7454
" He is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! - - so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! "    26.6249
" There is nothing the matter with me .    33.8201
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam .    96.8769
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ?    129.9762
Yes , I call it a very easy distance . "    32.4908
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt .    28.5403
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard .    185.9613
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane - - one does not often see any body better looking .    35.2837
They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone .    56.9360
All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .    20.5479
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word .    38.6894
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . "    34.4544
" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he    43.1600
has now concealed himself .    80.2705
" Do you really think so ? "    25.0076
She is grown so brown and coarse !    53.1265
Nor was Darcy's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .    37.8907
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended .    147.2782
My affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . "    37.6308
The wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this .    55.2730
Brother - in - law of Wickham !    101.4034
" No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . "    27.8603
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending    52.9039
to them in every way - - teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .    47.1306
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here .    66.7938
" It is no such thing .    21.8589
" What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment .    28.5738
Elizabeth looked surprised .    58.3069
" You are severe on us . "    17.2771
One ought not to repine ; - - but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me !    21.3861
Pray do not talk of that odious man .    28.4579
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing .    42.6320
We acted with the best intentions . "    45.5978
But the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .    49.6519
Her own thoughts were employing her .    56.7605
As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases , were seated    30.9874
in it .    192.0077
Mr . Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them .    35.5643
" But you will know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . "    27.8870
Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room , where Mrs . Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling    25.4893
on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .    34.0442
They were hopeless of remedy .    35.4191
Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness    61.6570
of a most beloved sister ? "    29.8007
" It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .    45.6764
With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his    54.0863
quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr . Darcy afterwards discharged .    34.0408
" Oh !    5.3941
Mr . Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding .    26.6557
Her ladyship was highly incensed .    31.8887
" How abominable ! - - I wonder that the very pride of this Mr . Darcy has not made him just to you ! - - If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , - - for dishonesty    33.9050
I must call it . "    19.7924
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by    37.1825
a thousand tender recollections .    351.5761
Her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace .    76.3623
Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of .    45.6326
"    N/A
Again she read on .    53.8812
" She is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there will probably be of some duration . "    26.6315
But still he would be her husband . - - Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness    90.0603
, must be their pleasantest preservative from want .    230.8612
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both    40.7319
that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses .    78.6019
Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before they did .    43.3671
To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs . Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others .    36.0075
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .    67.5388
But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . "    22.0001
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh .    20.3420
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am - - and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done .    27.1361
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man !    191.6558
" Ten thousand pounds !    55.0593
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ? "    40.5876
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill - consequences of Lydia's flight , on her own folly alone .    45.0113
She enquired after his sister , but could do no more .    32.4148
Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay .    29.6004
So much the better .    25.0552
I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy .    72.4323
You will be a very happy woman . "    12.9746
But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money .    45.8149
The particulars , I reserve till we meet .    106.2444
Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love ,    33.9109
her friend Eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out . - - She watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success .    39.9634
Elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it .    46.7729
how he must have felt it ! "    22.2348
Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant .    37.0041
Mr . Darcy may hug himself . "    12.1330
When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish .    94.3823
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ?    35.6223
There could not exist in the world two men , over whom Mr . Darcy could have such boundless influence .    38.7862
" Lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ?    17.0035
My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! "    39.1851
When Mrs . Bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before .    42.6139
Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Mr . Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . "    43.0644
" If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . "    36.4210
" I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . "    22.2551
He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish . "    31.6187
My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means    36.4320
certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you .    48.1577
On opening the door , she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other ,    54.0503
would have told it all .    41.3253
" How should you have liked making sermons ? "    44.4897
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .    45.0988
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . - - Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for Wickham ,    33.6250
resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness .    33.0034
But you do not know all .    17.1011
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might    53.1051
hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot .    62.4905
They were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something !    48.4944
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable .    36.6032
Mrs . Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .    32.9644
" But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .    66.7847
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not    42.4458
consider it entirely hopeless .    49.4512
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back .    68.4014
And who knows what may happen ?    80.9081
My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance .    35.5055
There is one point , on which I want your advice .    39.3507
Yes , there was something in that ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . "    36.3606
" It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , " said Mr . Bennet , " and nothing can clear Mr . Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn .    25.7603
She now lost every expectation of pleasure .    67.9444
Mr . Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other    28.1098
, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting .    53.4009
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !    173.2842
Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one    36.8496
of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .    104.3969
Mrs . Philips's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs . Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever    34.8381
she did speak , she must be vulgar .    75.8579
We do not suffer by accident .    53.8086
" La ! "    13.2716
I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together    32.1839
. "    1.0279
" Dear madam , " cried Mrs . Hill , in great astonishment , " don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr . Gardiner ?    57.5116
My reasons for believing it are briefly these : - - It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable .    69.1232
The moral will be perfectly fair .    51.1652
The prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits .    39.2999
They had frequently been staying with her in town .    44.9869
" I do not get on at all .    21.4744
I wish you had been there .    24.0575
The next was in these words .    58.5169
" And what is your success ? "    18.0123
From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him .    52.2342
She paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse .    37.8181
What is it you are talking of ?    73.9558
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved .    54.9286
I hope your plans in favour of the - - - - shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . "    19.1055
" Miss Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , " despises cards .    20.4549
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of .    23.1511
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch .    44.8353
Mrs . Bennet's eyes sparkled . - - " A gentleman and a stranger !    23.5512
" MY DEAR NIECE , " I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you .    42.8659
And for this we are to be thankful .    53.1266
What say you , Mary ?    89.7869
Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , Elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the    45.6775
first .    11735.3213
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names .    66.1866
But Mr . Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .    57.5147
Miss Lucas is married and settled .    62.5775
Elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this    43.1301
took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of    43.0526
their family party at Pemberley .    35.0981
Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs . Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by the bye , Mrs . Forster and me are such friends ! )    34.3422
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense .    62.6046
In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .    17.9408
When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times    46.3893
his consequence .    164.2496
All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road .    45.4615
I thought him very sly ; - - he hardly ever mentioned your name .    55.8364
" I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . - - We may compare our different opinions . "    41.6185
Those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable .    55.8235
" Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . "    38.3739
" Indeed I do not dare . "    20.6492
The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas !    26.6304
As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer .    32.1410
Mary , " said she , " I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun !    17.4179
" Gracechurch - street , Monday , August <NUMBER> .    61.8505
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure .    125.7420
We must have Mrs . Long and the Gouldings soon .    28.2151
" But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded .    29.2318
He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . "    32.1086
" My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken .    43.4016
you do not know what I suffer . "    9.7720
" Your's sincerely , & c . " Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere .    33.0934
Oh !    1.4661
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , - - but of this hereafter .    37.5342
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley .    21.7609
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .    45.9449
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good - natured , gossiping Lucases .    49.5739
If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .    21.6356
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters .    36.5642
Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr . Darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .    25.0036
cried his wife impatiently .    25.7650
" You certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . "    25.9807
" Oh ! "    3.3249
" But does Lydia know nothing of this ?    56.3628
His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal .    15.4979
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph .    66.0108
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr . Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her .    18.7455
Calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly .    55.9897
" How good it was in you , my dear Mr . Bennet !    27.8003
He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great !    42.0907
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh ?    51.0601
There can be no occasion for your going so soon .    40.8257
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height , or rather taller . "    54.6662
His daughter's request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , received at first an absolute negative .    58.9191
Mrs . Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received .    40.1531
Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr . Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening .    28.1451
Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner ,    59.4813
with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business .    35.9452
She was wild to be at home - - to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable    72.6910
of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe .    43.6918
When the ladies returned to the drawing - room , there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she    39.5918
was not used to have her judgment controverted .    84.8423
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ?    89.2755
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .    59.2537
" With three younger sisters grown up , " replied Elizabeth smiling , " your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . "    46.6801
I know you will contrive it all . "    29.1652
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .    44.0285
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North .    25.5087
Their reception at home was most kind .    46.8654
Pray read on . "    44.4518
" Why did not you all learn ? - - You ought all to have learned .    36.1422
" No , indeed , I did not . - - I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections .    24.2184
She is quite a little creature .    43.7117
But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ;    43.7783
and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise .    88.8887
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr . Wickham with money . "    24.5286
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ; and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure .    47.3151
The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . "    31.2060
After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference .    31.5707
Mrs . Bennet was really in a most pitiable state .    16.5520
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy .    59.5481
It is what every body says .    34.3840
I know it all ; that the young man's marrying her , was a patched - up business , at the expence of your father and uncles .    60.1442
Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .    59.4325
Her fellow - travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable .    62.4938
Here again I shall give you pain - - to what degree you only can tell .    80.3341
I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "    26.6238
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of    49.9995
the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St . James's .    55.0400
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs . Bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all .    58.2291
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! "    110.2883
Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this !    64.7056
You have liked many a stupider person . "    45.5138
Mrs . Gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder .    32.5945
But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it .    18.4352
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia .    31.9896
said Elizabeth , " but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . "    15.7062
Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .    32.8377
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness . "    37.2648
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . "    56.6904
" Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him .    31.8737
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before - hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least .    56.0778
" Do you suppose them to be in London ? "    19.7724
" I suspected as much , " replied Elizabeth .    26.0897
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . "    49.1424
The effect was immediate .    87.6789
" I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried Elizabeth .    18.3622
She does not yet leave her dressing - room .    33.5772
The introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such    39.2353
disgraceful companions .    32.7085
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart - felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings    45.5544
, which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable .    86.9788
On Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness .    23.4866
" Nay , " cried Bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .    46.0283
" Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . "    17.1891
Astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her .    43.9220
" I am exceedingly gratified , " said Bingley , " by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .    31.9523
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad .    27.3327
Indeed , Mr . Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire - - and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too - - for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things    29.7111
may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . "    53.4115
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying .    120.7424
I am sorry to pain you - - but so it was .    27.3505
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent .    67.4924
I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . "    17.5312
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference .    35.2144
If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him .    29.9361
There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance .    37.2404
I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun . "    43.3224
" I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but I always speak what I think . "    33.7554
It had better have happened to you , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner .    55.3069
had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do !    66.0088
I don't know .    177.6171
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness .    34.9409
And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr . Darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident .    40.4811
She had very little notice from any but him .    57.7802
Conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .    26.0493
" Yes , my youngest is not sixteen .    30.8031
Mr . Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours .    31.1746
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman's family .    30.6517
Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .    35.6361
Mr . Collins made his declaration in form .    31.3971
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy .    44.7057
If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up . "    19.5682
Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " But if that is the case , you must    26.7231
write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer .    31.2088
Darcy ! - - and so it does I vow .    30.8201
" A great deal of good management , depend upon it .    27.5301
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of their three months ' acquaintance they had been intimate two .    53.1570
He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .    37.3799
These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .    106.1763
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield .    37.0933
In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding    63.7145
herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise .    38.8745
Mrs . Gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its    35.5189
environs , to think of any thing else .    29.1328
On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . "    58.6996
so much the man of fashion !    46.2520
" I believe , Ma'am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him . "    25.5312
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for    68.1039
another disappointment .    106.8718
Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him .    19.8516
To this , Mary very gravely replied , " Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures .    60.7592
She could think only of her letter .    37.0566
" But , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , I am sure .    19.1455
" I will go to Meryton , " said she , " as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips .    21.0557
" Are they indeed ? "    57.6054
" And do you impute it to either of those ? "    45.9922
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation , and hurried her away to her room .    56.6369
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Mrs . Forster , the delight of Mrs . Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely to be described .    27.9401
His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the - - - - shire , and of his being gone into the regulars .    23.6241
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party . - - " I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , " said Lady Catherine ; " I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do .    28.3793
" I have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech .    19.2438
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself .    27.3161
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano - forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself .    51.5457
Charlotte says , she hardly ever does .    120.1638
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life .    45.3797
I am so pleased - - so happy .    61.4981
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn .    70.0430
Thank God !    73.0317
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference ; her's lasted a little longer ; and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her .    41.9739
I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . "    33.2374
The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me .    31.3513
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty - - which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless .    61.6595
From their infancy , they have been intended for each other .    33.2833
cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves .    8.7049
But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character !    45.1556
" Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter .    108.3223
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling .    77.4204
Who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ? "    50.9332
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day .    29.8762
He made no answer .    5.8824
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ; - - and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks .    65.0486
" Yes , very different .    24.2311
They then went away .    19.4086
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . "    34.2153
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr . Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her .    28.1756
Your's , very sincerely , " M .    34.8196
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it .    24.5507
cried Elizabeth , when she had finished .    11.1889
" In point of composition , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem defective .    23.8660
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance .    50.1956
" How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? "    27.5993
They were to be off as soon as possible .    12.0325
I am going away myself . "    25.3881
Mrs . Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton .    17.4055
said Jane . - - " I certainly saw Mr . Darcy speaking to her . "    16.0474
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?    53.7691
His affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend .    43.3007
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at    68.2742
some future time .    52.8997
" Did not you ?    62.5723
At present I am not in love with Mr . Wickham ; no , I certainly am not .    27.0822
" Oh ! "    3.3249
" Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .    34.0782
She held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house .    50.9214
" Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? "    79.5578
It would be dreadful !    26.3058
yes ; - - there is nothing in that .    26.4202
The carriage was sent to meet them at - - - - , and they were to return in it , by dinner - time .    30.0964
At length the Parsonage was discernible .    32.1235
They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . "    59.4606
Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation .    63.7876
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . "    80.5653
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . "    46.3790
She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter .    30.1513
But at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey .    20.4935
When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .    34.5543
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .    63.0623
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it .    47.7907
The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr .    33.6389
With many compliments to them , and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , - - to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs . Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness ,    40.4628
protested he must be entirely mistaken , and Lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , " Good Lord !    49.1928
Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs . Bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable .    48.6916
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .    63.5219
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony .    27.5726
And with a bow to Mr . Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . - - Many stared . - - Many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr . Bennet    29.7800
himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr . Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half - whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man .    38.9641
Elizabeth smiled .    30.7173
" Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often .    36.6983
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune    53.3295
.    N/A
The two youngest of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for    62.4303
the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .    62.9229
After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .    81.4867
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley's voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .    32.2764
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their    47.9173
daughters .    17.9303
Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , th October .    109.1768
Elizabeth , equally next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course .    153.2736
" I desire you will do no such thing .    51.2000
They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .    56.1812
His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , - - allowing something for fortune and figure . "    68.0243
But they did pass away , and Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at Longbourn .    24.4057
where is your sash my dear ? "    48.6880
Oh !    1.4661
Who are your uncles and aunts ?    88.0943
" If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge    33.0542
differently in the affair . "    12.8502
And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road . "    43.5982
It is Mr . Wickham's intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .    39.0515
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself - - from whom she    52.3152
had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question .    47.0779
Things are settled so oddly . "    24.0468
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the    35.2078
change without much reluctance .    148.0169
" Blame you !    68.4033
We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford    84.1733
visit cannot have been entirely irksome .    35.6741
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs . Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention    39.1121
, or mark her deference for his opinion .    66.0863
Her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her .    24.2041
If I may so express it , he has a right to be proud . "    34.2889
" I do not at all know ; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield .    32.3218
Smiles decked the face of Mrs . Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .    40.6208
She blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .    43.9533
said Elizabeth .    6.7466
You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these .    52.2413
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .    39.3929
Family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this .    49.8227
" A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever . "    44.5690
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . - - I know it cannot be long . "    24.8208
" He is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived .    18.3643
All was joy and kindness .    147.8596
Are the others coming out ? "    54.9446
You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it .    60.8881
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars .    33.8836
" Indeed ! "    12.9501
Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached .    45.2591
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did .    36.1754
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there .    102.3570
Jane's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .    53.9187
Mr . Hurst and Mr . Bingley were at piquet , and Mrs . Hurst was observing their game .    17.8666
I speak nothing but the truth .    64.1314
" How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr . Darcy , " she cried ; " I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter .    48.7753
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .    35.1253
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it - - or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short    50.3912
any thing or nothing .    27.8673
" Oh !    5.3941
This information , however , startled Mrs . Bennet ; - - she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so    28.0224
.    N/A
Mrs . Bennet was not in the habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together .    27.1868
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying - - and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . "    37.2804
" I beg your pardon .    21.0117
Again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification .    25.8889
You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be dissuaded from it .    48.0692
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information .    66.6290
Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character .    58.7777
A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . "    82.3284
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .    52.3877
Jane was by no means better .    14.3835
If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen .    25.2071
I will think no more about him . "    14.3824
Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself .    28.7517
It was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " How very    33.5735
suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr . Darcy !    73.3374
" Sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs . Bennet , alarmed .    22.7222
" You are mistaken .    18.2071
Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her .    31.5710
" Yes ; but when questioned by him Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it .    45.5377
On being made acquainted with the present Mr . Darcy's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Mr . Fitzwilliam    51.3822
Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy .    72.9513
Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . "    41.7040
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter .    56.7354
" I have , Sir . "    20.4172
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on    64.3728
hers .    3.0709
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation .    74.2185
She will not be able to help calling . "    23.0525
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr . Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged .    35.7703
You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters .    47.2182
I am the happiest creature in the world .    14.7210
In society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .    79.7213
Wickham's affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia's for him .    56.6953
" In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , " said Bingley ; " and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . "    25.2926
" And that I suppose is one of your sisters . "    15.5372
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth .    42.4420
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank - - such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady    49.0794
Catherine .    15.2912
" Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied Elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance .    46.0862
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards .    84.7743
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . "    45.3231
" No , " said her father , " Wickham's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds .    27.4850
She opened the door , and met Maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " Oh , my dear Eliza !    36.0197
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have    35.3636
supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when Mrs . Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only    54.8815
one of Lady Catherine's drawing - rooms , and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room .    36.8786
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock .    39.6400
Letters of business too !    100.2786
You have delighted us long enough .    64.6327
" An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth .    93.4459
But does not Jane correspond with the sister ?    86.4675
was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table .    19.7711
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation .    83.9443
said her mother .    15.4231
" Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?    49.9503
Mr . Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Mr . Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could .    38.7814
But what is that to me ?    66.7693
Oh !    1.4661
Collins ! "    9.2085
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .    33.5874
They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner    47.5786
to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .    43.6568
Mr . Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother's fortune , though ample for her situation in life ,    37.7575
could but ill supply the deficiency of his .    150.4702
Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness .    41.7700
" Miss Bingley told me , " said Jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance .    33.1349
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .    82.5648
cried Lydia .    13.9995
But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill - judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might    57.5416
at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .    42.5031
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him .    44.5984
- - My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose    32.6473
bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England    67.1241
.    N/A
What a stroke was this for poor Jane !    162.3003
she repeated .    364.1384
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps .    31.9233
what news ?    897.3912
Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr . Hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was    64.4058
going forward .    167.3172
Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano - forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view    57.8040
of the fair performer's countenance .    164.3965
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the    40.4678
present .    3910.6714
We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve .    38.0553
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house .    41.3677
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Mr . Wickham and herself .    22.5195
You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .    50.8572
After pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read .    95.0252
He heard her attentively , and then said , " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present    44.1595
circumstances . "    8.6550
What pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have !    102.4563
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been    51.0591
formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend .    61.2626
When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .    38.6233
Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .    83.0648
You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body .    55.0242
" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? "    28.2890
The loo table , however , did not appear .    33.3159
Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection .    40.9804
" Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . "    42.1770
" I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley's sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .    35.7689
" You appear to me , Mr . Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .    32.6922
The business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news .    55.0489
But she would not be secure .    24.7785
Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party    17.6366
.    N/A
We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing .    68.0292
" Exceed their income !    216.0208
He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday .    29.1522
They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . "    41.5318
Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on .    42.9572
His doing so drew her notice .    96.6094
" It must have been his sister's doing .    33.6548
" My motive for cautioning you , is as follows .    30.1206
You are not well enough ; - - you cannot go yourself . "    15.8231
" What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? "    28.6976
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much .    54.5336
No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village .    45.6274
She read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes .    35.8328
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr . Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .    35.2726
" You must not blame my aunt .    21.2206
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter .    58.9041
Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ?    87.1938
" You began the evening well , Charlotte , " said Mrs . Bennet with civil self - command to Miss Lucas .    30.6475
When they had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , " This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal .    51.0588
I had not an idea of it . "    20.0762
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr . Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord - - - - and to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr . Collins    22.3510
returned the gentlemen accompanied him .    43.8630
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem .    54.9411
I knew you would be wishing me joy . "    28.3627
Mrs . Bennet could hardly contain herself .    12.2920
" Mr . Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ?    26.9752
On the gentlemen's appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance .    56.3649
To these high flown expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr .    46.2102
Bingley's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his .    35.2516
" I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied Jane , " and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .    28.7087
what could she mean by it ?    57.3169
He was most highly esteemed by Mr . Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend .    40.5374
my dear Lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? "    26.5464
" I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other .    36.6500
He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said .    45.6355
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " Mr . Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which    34.0810
Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? "    92.5643
Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room    25.4066
.    N/A
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much .    41.6872
Mrs . Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas    46.9251
, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war - office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton .    69.4064
" Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? "    47.3536
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .    59.6411
" Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled .    40.9476
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room .    21.5480
" But if you have got them to - day , " said Elizabeth , " my mother's purpose will be answered . "    23.4434
But as it is - - you must not let your fancy run away with you .    45.6791
But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . "    79.3931
We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which    52.4534
there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way .    33.6953
He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . "    25.2832
nonsense , how can you talk so !    52.3629
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet    46.1172
, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful .    63.8986
" I do not mind his not talking to Mrs . Long , " said Miss Lucas , " but I wish he had danced with Eliza . "    24.8163
His attachment to Rosings , certainly increases . "    60.9646
Mr . Collins was also in the same state of angry pride .    23.7132
But that is one great difference between us .    78.4763
and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son ?    43.7190
Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .    28.6146
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .    39.4757
This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place .    84.2969
Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken    56.4593
leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs .    57.3662
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do .    34.2463
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off    60.7409
every arrear of civility to Elizabeth .    45.3431
That is the place to get husbands .    51.6354
Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley .    48.0406
Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? "    39.2452
She was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr . Darcy , she was directly retreating .    24.3656
This was a lucky recollection - - it saved her from something like regret .    86.4209
Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner . '    65.3193
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .    36.6496
But gracious me !    566.1114
Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , ( glancing at her sister and Bingley , )    45.5961
shall take place .    44.4747
cried Miss Bingley .    8.4352
Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .    12.4888
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business .    46.3235
His temptation is not adequate to the risk . "    26.8141
" Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight .    27.6292
They must all go to Brighton .    36.9335
But with me , it is not so .    15.3324
" I cannot believe it .    13.2324
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . "    34.8259
What are you telling Miss Bennet ?    65.0018
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr . Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr . Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .    40.0922
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings .    30.5080
Miss Bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room .    39.0277
" It is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .    17.2389
From what can it proceed ?    73.7280
why did she come ?    71.4913
A younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . "    27.6267
And pray what sort of guardians do you make ?    74.3046
Mrs . Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " Well , Jane , who is it from ?    30.2688
and it was not wholly without foundation .    55.9713
Their fortune on both sides is splendid .    150.0653
When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr . Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation    32.9505
of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel .    61.8071
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr . Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself .    35.6487
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value    48.0072
as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration .    62.0359
Bingley . - - But - - good lord !    35.9508
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life .    26.8615
" My dear Jane ! "    6.6840
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr . Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr .    40.6636
Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " I do not imagine his business would have    38.7342
called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . "    44.8410
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .    55.1019
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .    192.0817
There was no help for it however .    35.3145
Mrs . Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but Mr . Collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should    49.3245
never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr . Bennet , and prepared for backgammon .    57.7490
As they drove to Mr . Gardiner's door , Jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and    39.4112
lovely as ever .    105.0803
She began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .    54.2529
When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .    32.5583
Mrs . Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill    56.0154
usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .    73.5007
Oh !    1.4661
It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much    29.2291
in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions    32.2201
of the impertinent .    89.5710
His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .    59.8081
His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham .    42.3876
" From what we have seen of him , " continued Mrs . Gardiner , " I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham .    25.9006
Oh !    1.4661
" Yes , very handsome . "    16.0331
She stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent .    54.1070
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to .    36.7192
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then was .    35.5982
" Who do you mean , my dear ?    18.3023
cried Elizabeth when she had finished it .    20.6777
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs . Bennet and the children .    29.6200
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire .    31.0624
And though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case .    31.5173
He did every thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September , than any body else in the country .    21.9610
You must not disappoint your father . "    20.6401
They agreed that Mrs . Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the    35.3222
ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together .    34.7040
I hate such false friends .    130.3878
" No ; but it must be done soon . "    17.3705
" Yes - - but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . "    21.2272
" They have both , " said she , " been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea .    28.5589
Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off .    41.4858
Mr . Bennet made no answer .    5.1518
He bore it however with admirable calmness .    89.3535
" Lizzy , you must not do so .    21.8416
" Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when that will be .    23.8172
Why Jane - - you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing !    77.9771
" I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ?    23.4865
" Mr . Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again .    27.7288
" I know not , Miss Elizabeth , " said he , " whether Mrs . Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it .    25.5072
Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he    54.7285
alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances .    46.9328
He was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty .    36.0928
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , - - that I am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at    45.2626
heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day .    78.9580
" You may as well call it impertinence at once .    89.8488
But my dear Lydia , I don't at all like your going such a way off .    43.2992
" Your first position is false .    70.6353
Wickham is safe . "    18.7863
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . "    27.4764
His disposition must be dreadful . "    19.3245
" Oh !    5.3941
The invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing - room .    32.9384
" But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr . Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . "    19.5359
They will ruin your happiness .    52.5157
Mr . Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's .    37.0510
" Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! "    30.5735
" I beg your pardon ; - - one knows exactly what to think . "    31.3746
" Oh !    5.3941
Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .    34.9105
He has children of his own , and may have more .    43.1864
The discussion of Mr . Collins's offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother .    49.0096
" Has your governess left you ? "    69.5953
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .    41.1365
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .    44.3759
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the - - - - shire Militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance .    27.8324
The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence . - - " He is now gone into the army , "    26.9748
she added , " but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . "    18.9182
The wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual .    44.8696
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr . Collins joining in , observed , " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say    34.0310
you will be delighted with her .    16.6171
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .    46.3411
It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard . "    39.9522
He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but this is the true one .    78.9660
And a special licence .    31.6711
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . "    29.3344
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr . Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them .    28.6609
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " It is your turn to say something now , Mr .    56.0671
But you have chosen your fault well . - - I really cannot laugh at it .    44.8449
I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character . "    61.6567
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner .    87.7333
I write rather slowly . "    61.0853
Oh , Lizzy !    19.1629
Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him    56.8399
gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . "    56.2059
Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure .    65.1114
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes - - but by everybody else Mr    55.8360
. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men .    56.7202
But I am at his disposal .    29.1315
" Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say .    17.0635
It was dated from Rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows : - - " Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers    34.7557
, which were last night so disgusting to you .    73.1729
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance .    45.5560
dear me !    18.2545
But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .    70.2125
To Mr . Darcy it was welcome intelligence - - Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough .    49.4761
As long as she stays there , it is all very well .    34.3624
Is nothing due to me on that score ?    120.4019
" I never thought Mr . Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . "    27.5966
This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving .    70.0823
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address .    63.7798
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds .    51.3294
While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner . - - Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship , and her manner of    37.6795
living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at St . James's .    31.3367
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs . Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton .    35.8240
" Whatever my connections may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . "    20.3427
In that case he would return no more .    66.1393
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married .    51.2060
He was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . "    60.5541
I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been .    49.2524
Mr . Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth - - and it was soon done - - done while Mrs . Bennet was stirring the fire .    30.5726
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . "    39.7796
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth    39.8816
; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give    40.6061
.    N/A
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt , and all Mr . Collins's scruples of leaving Mr . and Mrs . Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at    46.9565
a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing - room , that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation , and was then in the house .    17.9332
cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her .    50.8029
Mr . Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .    22.7278
Jane looked at her doubtingly .    13.8591
I shall be back by dinner . "    24.7984
" Of music !    163.4774
" I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . "    33.3339
" Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , " said Elizabeth .    21.2901
" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? "    86.2033
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard , and if he does ,    58.4891
Colonel Forster will hire him .    40.4714
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly .    115.3924
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt .    43.2011
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology , " " Hunsford , " and "    28.0928
Lady Catherine de Bourgh . "    3.5586
I hope we may often meet again . "    34.3866
She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther .    47.7866
" In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . "    28.6608
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy .    54.6901
" Ah !    21.3130
She was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness . - - Mr .    33.0510
And when you have given your ball , " she added , " I shall insist on their giving one also .    35.3534
Be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business .    98.3079
But to be candid without ostentation or design - - to take the good of every body's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad - - belongs to you alone .    50.8102
" But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well . "    25.8221
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects .    55.1604
" I knew , " said he , " that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .    16.9770
No one but Jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation .    37.2357
" Oh , Lizzy !    14.2010
She blushed , and Jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour .    44.8462
Elizabeth was now to see Mr . Wickham for the last time .    14.7788
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane    63.6656
or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .    108.3881
He added , that Mr . Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave London , and promised to write again very soon .    33.8994
Mr . Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ?    37.2502
" Yes , or I will never see her again . "    13.3507
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .    52.8083
I do not deserve it .    12.0813
You have a sweet room here , Mr . Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk .    46.0966
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable .    43.0501
I cannot understand it .    27.6337
She then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , " Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , " took her out of the room .    41.7114
Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . "    32.3121
" I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness .    36.6195
" You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth .    16.6211
He now wished it more than ever .    63.6640
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself .    48.3225
She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family .    57.6640
While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning .    79.8304
When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . "    22.8322
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity .    32.2478
" And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added Kitty .    51.3149
Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . "    11.1110
Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .    31.2579
She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ; gone to stay .    76.5975
I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing .    30.5420
Her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil .    43.4076
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family .    56.0226
" Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth .    29.5499
" My dear father , I congratulate you . "    15.3062
Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .    37.4175
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light .    43.9637
You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs . Collins .    22.6628
Have you had any flirting ?    50.5931
Mr . Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family .    48.9465
I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her .    63.0796
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage .    134.2072
Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs . Bennet instantly answered , " Oh dear ! - - Yes - - certainly . - - I am sure Lizzy will be very happy - - I am sure she can have no    23.4125
objection . - - Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs . "    22.1552
" It keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . "    19.8928
There was also a postscript to this effect .    44.3881
As soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte's sake , she made more favourable than it really was .    27.1213
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a    31.4893
succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once .    119.0589
" You have said quite enough , madam .    62.0011
They are my old friends .    97.5350
She remembered also , that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking    58.7358
Mr . Darcy's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son .    29.0938
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St . James's , with very decent composure .    42.3579
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . "    27.3421
I told Mrs . Collins so before you came .    38.3004
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect .    78.7078
" Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy .    29.2978
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .    28.1671
I am glad he is gone .    22.7779
With your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others !    64.4362
" He only told me , what I have now told you . "    25.6323
" What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ?    16.1188
I will leave him to himself . "    20.5862
Elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation .    48.4389
" But you see that Jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . "    18.2335
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned .    26.1863
" May we take my uncle's letter to read to her ? "    42.0571
After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant , there chanced to be a little    31.5587
alteration .    145.4124
I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .    33.3380
There is nothing else to be done .    8.9340
It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel's family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best .    35.0336
It was at Sir William Lucas's , where a large party were assembled .    43.5018
A clear ten thousand per annum .    142.0554
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . "    45.2221
" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . "    47.4844
His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased .    48.9817
" You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , - - therefore you need not conceal your age . "    23.9590
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern .    39.0172
" I believe she did - - and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . "    25.1807
Elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .    47.3673
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty .    48.4469
To Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself .    24.1583
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight .    202.6108
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! "    74.3274
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her .    24.4060
" Is it not clear enough ? - - Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him ,    48.2909
she means ( most kindly ! )    367.9346
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him .    32.9958
" What could he mean ?    44.9862
She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself .    55.9203
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring .    31.3907
I know we dine with four and twenty families . "    64.6201
" But consider your daughters .    100.0525
Painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled .    52.1271
" Aye - - because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; - - but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . "    27.9478
" Yes , all of them , I think .    32.9141
She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself .    32.5071
She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will make her know it . "    22.6755
Let me never see either one or the other again ! "    44.8272
So far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great .    59.7446
With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself .    58.7137
These are conditions , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you .    29.7028
said she .    27.0139
Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week .    37.4171
" Certainly , Sir ; - - and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world . - - Every savage can dance . "    30.3450
" Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room . "    33.2485
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? "    37.1553
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself .    33.9283
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield .    55.0299
" If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it would not make them one jot less agreeable . "    30.4688
His reception however was of the most flattering kind .    78.4016
" Well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " What say you to the day ?    21.5387
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .    37.5913
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement .    25.6187
she cried . - - " I , who have prided myself on my discernment ! - - I , who have valued myself on my abilities !    35.9605
But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it .    22.1456
And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .    31.3272
Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano - forte was opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it .    19.1752
Mr . Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency .    29.8656
Excuse me - - for I must speak plainly .    37.9642
" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! "    65.6664
" Not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . "    34.9262
And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow's debts , and got him his commission !    82.0201
" I should imagine not . "    46.1564
" Never , sir . "    39.5200
Mrs . Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .    26.5343
Mr . Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my love .    39.0790
" You can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered .    40.4431
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children . - - Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body .    27.0006
No thanks to his gallantry for that .    120.4460
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr . Bingley - - is not he ?    45.2156
He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . "    40.8910
Occupied in observing Mr . Bingley's attentions to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend .    25.9152
Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable .    30.6762
I am only ashamed of his asking so little . "    23.9223
Mrs . Hill began instantly to express her joy .    53.2095
With such rivals for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs .    35.4087
Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .    36.1438
It must be an amusing study . "    35.6498
There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much .    50.3654
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame .    31.6835
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret .    35.9023
You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him .    32.0177
" My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? "    30.2425
" My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these .    21.7596
" My fingers , " said Elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do .    27.7365
* * * * * In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .    19.8902
" When I consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that I might have prevented it ! - - I who knew what he was .    30.3862
Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home .    53.4033
He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane .    47.1359
GARDINER . "    1.3058
He is so excessively handsome !    44.7485
The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you .    40.4936
His letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution .    48.4893
My dear aunt , how could you think of it ?    12.0881
" I can easily believe it .    20.9806
" Not at all , " he replied ; " they were brightened by the exercise . "    15.7812
This however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of    70.0819
doors .    51.9276
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! "    30.0850
said Elizabeth to herself . - - " You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this .    34.9889
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . "    64.2112
" Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? "    75.7628
But his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr . Wickham , his cruelty    37.2834
towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited .    42.0937
I see the imprudence of it . - - Oh !    17.3780
" But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said Jane .    18.0664
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .    47.0743
I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all .    66.6446
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure .    37.0133
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view .    46.2263
that he should have been in love with her for so many months !    20.4120
I cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . "    48.1064
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . "    45.2814
His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " What is that you are saying ,    59.2982
Fitzwilliam ?    84.9748
" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs . Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was    30.6797
so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr . Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . "    44.2187
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .    22.7493
Such very superior dancing is not often seen .    169.8324
When the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers Mr . Wickham was sure to be one ; and on these occasions , Mrs . Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him , narrowly observed    43.9332
them both .    41.2699
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will .    67.1540
Her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object .    60.3175
" As much as I ever wish to be , " cried Elizabeth warmly , - - " I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . "    28.7744
my sweetest Lizzy !    80.2521
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over . - - To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had    30.4340
been self imposed .    376.9057
You refuse , then , to oblige me .    43.1862
said Elizabeth .    6.7466
Why any fear of detection ?    132.1131
Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re - kindled the admiration of her former lover .    52.5207
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot .    54.9203
" Did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ?    21.0345
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .    27.1181
" It is amazing to me , " said Bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . "    16.0253
It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage .    28.5212
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . "    20.7499
Now what have you to say ? "    28.5838
Darcy . - - I talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . "    22.7262
This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas .    71.6601
That he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating . "    18.7392
To this speech Bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations .    41.2183
I could hardly keep my countenance .    46.5582
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself - - for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . "    33.4266
Elizabeth was delighted .    32.7983
- - said Jane as she finished it .    35.3002
no , no , this is not likely .    119.8100
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned !    61.3512
Mrs . Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself .    61.9121
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ?    93.9172
We neither of us perform to strangers . "    48.9726
Every thing being settled between them , Mr . Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch - street the evening before I came home .    37.1067
" We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care .    40.5784
can it be really so !    101.2526
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs . Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate - - but on this point it will be as well to be silent .    36.9610
said Mr . Gardiner .    8.6969
" I should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man . "    33.3168
At last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance .    46.4584
" And of your infliction , " cried Elizabeth with energy .    20.4868
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report    28.5231
; and I know I appeared distressed .    68.4635
Bingley was by no means deficient , but Darcy was clever .    34.8199
" No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . "    59.2691
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire - place , that she might be farther from the door .    37.8374
" How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it !    27.0060
so genteel and so easy ! - - He has always something to say to every body . - - That is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . "    45.0253
" You cannot be too much on your guard .    24.8833
It was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single    62.3774
daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .    22.2085
How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? "    123.9853
No one made any reply .    102.5002
For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . Darcy's , but you shall do as you chuse . "    25.1011
added Elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . "    52.0874
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs . Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr . Bingley's continued absence .    44.6624
On Miss Lucas's persevering , however , she added , " Very well ; if it must be so , it must . "    20.3453
More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .    76.8311
" I should be sorry indeed , if it were .    26.6425
" I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us .    48.2419
" Not the slightest .    86.0829
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .    125.1024
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr . Darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur    40.1228
or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .    48.0867
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr . Bennet coolly observed , " From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country .    36.8608
" Dearest Jane !    78.2463
While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever .    40.6670
You are not going to be Missish , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report .    34.4326
Mr . Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .    44.4455
" Have you any other objection , " said Elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? "    15.9862
" I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him .    24.0562
Collins . "    3.6234
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr . Darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would    35.2724
endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .    32.8127
I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town .    36.5085
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .    35.4315
But do not be cast down .    72.1678
Till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance .    15.0913
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .    31.2635
At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house .    27.2787
Darcy ! - - My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to forfeit it .    37.7755
the ladies had crowded round the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair .    36.4770
Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . "    40.7965
" Oh !    5.3941
In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh !    56.1696
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear .    63.2928
You are safe from me . "    21.8172
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them .    33.1496
His brother - in - law , Mr . Hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr . Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general    46.9870
circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year .    23.1793
It will pass away soon enough . "    53.0681
" Such as vanity and pride . "    73.0474
Mr . Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , & c . Mrs . Bennet was quite disconcerted .    17.2240
who attended to you ?    84.0958
There was another reason too for her opposition .    109.6836
It is a pity they are not handsome !    27.8203
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either .    36.7727
certainly , " said Elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; " we will ask you no questions . "    43.8438
Mrs . Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .    32.5928
Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure .    22.8995
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . "    37.6756
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now .    25.1886
Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly . "    41.2410
The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune .    36.8223
It was all pride and insolence .    41.2746
Mr . Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter .    22.9333
I am so happy .    25.2910
" I hope , " added Mrs . Gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her .    31.4368
I dare say Mr . Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word    35.9093
for my little Lizzy . "    54.0721
That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .    30.0840
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal .    57.3510
" You doubt me , " cried Jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no reason .    29.0475
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of    48.2708
any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .    40.1846
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .    51.1057
said Miss Bingley ; " will she be as tall as I am ? "    28.1898
" Perhaps we might be deceived . "    30.0184
" You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew !    43.3627
For my part , Mr . Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently .    92.6029
Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? "    44.0692
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half - expectation which Mrs . Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .    52.1134
The officers will find women better worth their notice .    108.8723
This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr . Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him .    34.6913
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter ; and detestable as such a step    55.8285
must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go .    62.1351
In as short a time as Mr . Collins's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of    38.5439
men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .    28.5050
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs . Forster to Meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .    50.9425
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . - - But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .    52.8849
" That is the most unforgiving speech , " said Elizabeth , " that I ever heard you utter .    17.7580
My fingers wait your orders . "    115.9936
If he no longer cares for me , why silent ?    115.5160
You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? "    16.7696
I cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago .    63.4436
Such a countenance , such manners !    51.6462
Mr . Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it .    32.6423
it is of no consequence .    58.5521
But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments .    45.6135
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . "    24.7642
" Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . "    38.7537
Since the - - - - shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head .    34.4297
" Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . "    51.6575
Mrs . Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head .    41.9657
" That is a question which Mr . Darcy only can answer . "    18.6779
" For the liveliness of your mind , I did . "    28.7145
repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .    70.4836
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .    58.6329
She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs . Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr . Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy .    34.4374
Lydia was Lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless .    80.4028
" What is Mr . Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ?    15.5705
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible .    36.8222
" Yours , & c . " " Well , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort    21.5545
to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr . Bingley , and under your orders . "    21.8622
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton .    25.0312
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room .    32.5313
But that is not the case here .    44.7924
Is it true ? "    56.6265
The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr . Bingley from your sister , - - and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the    34.3298
immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of Mr .    18.5611
" While I can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . - - I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .    30.0814
" Her not objecting , does not justify him .    79.5781
Mrs . Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr . Darcy by character perfectly well .    36.1674
This was his plan of amends - - of atonement - - for inheriting their father's estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part .    51.3193
They gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with    43.5217
some abruptness wound .    23.0900
My poor father !    62.4766
After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near Elizabeth , said to her - - " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an    44.7406
opportunity of dancing a reel ? "    19.0958
At length Darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " Mr . Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends - - whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . "    41.5788
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn .    47.7275
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture .    70.6327
" If he wants our society , let him seek it .    64.4295
" We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said Elizabeth .    48.4562
When they repaired to the dining - room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister .    22.5867
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could    40.5736
think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .    39.3504
" I have no right to give my opinion , " said Wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise .    24.4041
Oh !    1.4661
shocking ! "    6.9399
" How so ?    269.0620
Heaven and earth ! - - of what are you thinking ?    22.4444
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as    46.0485
her's , he might become a very agreeable companion .    45.7873
But I have other provocations .    64.0085
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name ; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she    36.4364
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .    60.2632
She smiled , but made no answer .    17.7087
But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to Charlotte's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do    42.0740
, which was the more probable from the time of year .    42.5216
Nothing could be more delightful !    48.6291
Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat .    28.2031
I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins's character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . "    37.3175
Wont it , Kitty ? "    38.3481
He studies too much for words of four syllables . - - Do not you , Darcy ? "    43.4079
You shall hear what she says . "    22.1002
It was only said , ' Lately , George Wickham , Esq .    61.9480
" Yes ; to the last .    69.6159
As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper .    60.6592
" A little . "    20.7802
" The present always occupies you in such scenes - - does it ? "    60.7138
" And my mother - - How is she ?    33.8933
do not repeat what I then said .    27.4462
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear .    90.7723
All this was acknowledged to Mrs . Gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : - - " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and    25.3884
elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil .    63.8646
To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .    85.3206
repeated Mr . Bennet .    6.5158
She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us    47.2250
. "    1.0279
" You may depend upon my not mentioning it . "    21.0531
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts . "    50.2958
She will be taken good care of .    111.4053
For God's sake , say no more of his partners .    77.2675
He does not want abilities .    85.0002
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks .    41.2453
And poor Mr . Darcy !    25.2924
With a stronger voice she soon added , " I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . "    28.9664
Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , if you had rather not .    29.5879
repeated Miss Bingley .    15.5681
Oh , sister !    177.7273
What he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind    72.8541
of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . "    41.9293
So imprudent a match on both sides ! - - But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .    30.7396
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command .    50.7034
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened .    49.3434
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense .    54.5228
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine .    37.0629
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs . Bennet's civilities .    51.6048
Mr . Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention .    13.9357
cried Mrs . Bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley !    30.2603
She declared her resolution .    92.9542
That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .    65.5158
" John told us Mr . Darcy was here when you sent for us ; - - was it so ? "    45.7265
And , above all things , keep Mr . Bennet from fighting .    59.1094
Oh , Lydia ! "    17.0314
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance !    69.9782
He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed .    31.9734
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more    51.9103
dispirited than she found them .    28.9395
Other schemes too came into her head .    73.0348
Will you come and see me ? "    20.1370
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .    29.3788
" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? "    54.4193
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . - - Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr . Collins , and I will never see you again if you do . "    14.6888
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . "    18.8863
" I never can be thankful , Mr . Bennet , for any thing about the entail .    14.6969
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other .    35.5341
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday .    30.9748
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door - bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .    32.4261
Mr . Darcy had been at her sister's wedding .    15.9602
" And have you heard from him often ? "    36.1187
The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness !    40.6612
He owns it himself without disguise . "    63.0618
By tea - time however the dose had been enough , and Mr . Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing - room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .    27.3374
Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them .    33.6113
It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say nothing of that .    31.9386
what is it about ?    59.4698
You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him .    22.2052
It is useless to talk of it . "    12.6921
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation    103.5595
.    N/A
" My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . "    34.1728
thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! "    47.3942
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise - - and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .    34.8105
" No , she would go home .    28.7227
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope    58.9145
that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another .    49.9381
But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out .    35.0477
But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . "    40.7956
" But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about .    42.6686
" And that , " said Mrs . Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master - - and very like him .    30.2079
They were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of Mrs . Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt .    29.1231
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had    28.6396
lost in refusing him .    43.0024
If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . "    24.2109
" I would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried Bingley , " for a kingdom !    16.9767
About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry    40.0784
, and calling loudly after her .    141.4778
" But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required .    51.6163
My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs . Hurst were going out .    41.7026
Mrs . Bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could .    20.7642
" Oh , Jane , take care . "    38.6897
Have you never happened to see her there ? "    23.2782
" Except , " thought Elizabeth , " when she goes to Ramsgate . "    18.6466
Had I but explained some part of it only - - some part of what I learnt , to my own family !    61.5135
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . "    28.6586
Lydia - - the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes ,    41.7041
was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I    49.4468
any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .    74.7045
Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance .    57.3612
I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy .    58.0856
Darcy ! "    5.3275
I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him .    42.2189
" I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! "    54.7994
" You may well warn me against such an evil .    39.6375
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation .    62.9537
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .    53.7573
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder .    92.8596
It must be his own doing . - - He is his own master .    21.8998
" I do not believe a word of it , my dear .    10.1778
To Pemberley , therefore , they were to go .    18.6979
After discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society    51.1274
that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to    33.7478
take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .    46.7753
How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book ! - - When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . "    28.6734
Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . "    57.1993
Lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , I dare say Mr . Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . "    23.1859
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth ,    39.2497
that for some time all intercourse was at an end .    76.9882
How odious I should think them ! "    60.9595
My father bears it better .    61.1258
My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . "    61.2917
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance .    58.4332
In this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying    45.8542
perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence .    29.1396
But the clothes , the wedding clothes !    122.5835
On finding Mrs . Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the    39.8461
honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? "    24.3390
Is her husband , is the son of his late father's steward , to be his brother ?    31.2533
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost .    45.0123
" Indeed , Mr . Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary .    29.1074
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .    36.9271
Her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr . Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste    32.9019
, was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .    41.8656
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining - parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for    49.6007
Mr . Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement .    40.1436
He cannot afford it .    59.3580
" It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . "    37.8652
After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I do remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper .    32.4655
" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would - - I do congratulate you - - but are you certain ?    26.5143
But when she read , and re - read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate .    57.0748
Elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion .    53.1064
She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success .    29.0593
Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; Mrs . Reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister .    48.7331
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause .    233.1800
" Oh , yes ! - - he was to come there with Wickham , you know .    32.5603
It was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from Jane .    25.0800
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual .    54.3009
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room .    40.9430
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball - - and at this ball , what do you think he did ?    36.7857
" I might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?    50.1742
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again !    68.1014
" But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . "    26.7909
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .    42.3578
" What think you of books ? "    23.4443
She wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false !    70.0213
" I have been making the tour of the Park , " he replied , " as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage .    37.0400
" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? "    38.5791
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs .    89.0239
Bromley , of course . - - If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to . "    24.0695
Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self - destined to another .    68.1770
It was a fortnight since Mrs . Bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high .    36.7653
" Oh !    5.3941
" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? "    22.7568
When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music .    37.2638
When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .    51.7049
And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had !    56.7900
She was sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him .    40.0569
By you , I was properly humbled .    61.4876
" Ah !    21.3130
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before .    38.7988
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs . Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were    35.3649
wished away by some of the family .    34.1777
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself    35.0631
that her wishes did not err .    103.4385
There was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected    37.8373
.    N/A
They soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind .    17.8180
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time .    52.7210
Mr . Wickham began the subject himself .    24.6153
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence    63.9941
with the most forbearing courtesy .    37.3849
But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you .    24.6643
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs .    27.6743
That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny .    33.3629
I will take care of myself , and of Mr . Wickham too .    32.2599
Mrs . Bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness .    39.3539
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr . Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs .    34.8284
Mr . Denny and Mr . Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr . Philips's house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs . Philips '    35.7675
throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation .    38.4731
cried Mrs . Gardiner .    7.8963
" And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did .    35.6474
Lydia laughed , and said , " Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion .    52.9554
Oh !    1.4661
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty - headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise .    37.9382
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr . and Mrs . Collins sat down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs . Jenkinson to make up her party .    26.1028
" And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma'am ? "    33.4331
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable .    41.1805
Ten thousand a year !    8.8685
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom .    46.1740
He has more to give .    72.1990
" I will not trust myself on the subject , " replied Wickham , " I can hardly be just to him . "    14.6626
The easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him .    39.5920
and what can he have to say ? "    52.6818
" This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , " said he .    12.4767
" Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister .    32.5691
He was angry .    42.5066
And taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , " Indeed , Sir , I    29.3010
have not the least intention of dancing . - - I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . "    38.6012
When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria's alarm was every moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm . - - Elizabeth's courage did not fail her .    44.0932
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity .    114.2586
" Your friend performs delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; - - " and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr .    46.1327
You will only think I feel more than I ought to do , when I tell you all . "    23.7955
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children , it should not be of my own however . "    41.3612
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you . "    58.0276
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty .    57.3723
From the entrance hall , of which Mr . Collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti - chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs . Jenkinson    41.0224
were sitting . - - Her Ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs . Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those    35.5355
apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary .    53.3477
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .    55.6923
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself .    42.1177
" I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had .    37.6001
" This is wholly unexpected .    39.1469
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on .    53.5495
What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?    52.6203
They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . Bingley's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .    65.1506
Mrs . Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew    43.3068
, that Mr . Denny had brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the - - - - shire .    17.0802
He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening .    53.0861
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it . "    25.8023
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?    105.2306
" And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress !    25.4769
" Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? "    20.8844
Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters .    27.0534
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this .    28.2846
It was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture .    42.9702
" Very well .    25.0168
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us .    15.5703
" Did Mr . Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? "    41.4444
How are you all ? "    22.4085
" Take whatever you like , and get away . "    51.3713
Both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .    79.7701
As soon as Jane had read Mr . Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance .    52.8611
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side , the acquaintance    45.9534
would now be renewed .    34.8218
The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed - rooms , were all that remained to be shewn .    28.4151
Poor dear child !    86.4727
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you    47.6907
.    N/A
" With great energy ; - - but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . "    30.4310
My feelings in every respect forbid it .    45.6087
What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ?    56.7232
" We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply .    24.7256
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing - room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house .    21.1281
" My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them - - by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . "    57.6812
I am not romantic you know .    32.1045
I am perfectly serious in my refusal . - - You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so . - - Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me ,    22.3863
I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . "    29.2381
In a few minutes , Mrs . Bennet half opened the door and called out , " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . "    11.6933
She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave .    42.0410
She felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they    48.1682
had gained .    120.8447
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Mrs . Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .    49.3751
He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . "    27.6735
I have not been accustomed to such language as this .    40.1939
" I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . "    40.6560
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could .    21.6568
" He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied Elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . "    23.3661
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough .    46.2797
" I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . "    46.8882
" My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . "    25.2142
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .    56.2732
" This account then is what he has received from Mr . Darcy .    41.7987
We can all begin freely - - a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement .    71.5172
I do not believe she often sees such at home . "    38.2927
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs . Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs . Bennet's sour looks and    42.9399
ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .    37.2780
" I am all astonishment .    57.6037
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes .    70.3373
Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your    33.3271
understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity    48.6472
with the highest rank in the kingdom - - provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .    43.0571
If he fears me , why come hither ?    128.6636
When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . "    22.3252
How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !    119.1921
And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .    23.4512
You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created . "    20.5945
She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over .    55.5984
Yes , he had no engagement at all for to - morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .    40.4380
" Very well - - and this offer of marriage you have refused ? "    29.3725
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips's .    46.8179
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'night following , which    46.9828
I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .    50.3590
It is every way horrible ! "    27.1854
But it was her business to be satisfied - - and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .    42.8133
" He has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !    25.7175
If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . "    28.8812
" Let me be rightly understood .    100.7521
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece .    41.7075
how rich and how great you will be !    42.6814
She got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour .    18.6349
" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news .    23.1263
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances : - - and to have Mr . Collins instead !    49.2758
your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . - - Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father .    44.3711
she cried .    181.1463
You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert .    35.3509
My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him .    20.3908
Elizabeth almost stared at her . - - " Can this be Mr .    36.4659
Yet now I must believe you , " cried Jane .    20.0759
" FITZWILLIAM DARCY . "    37.8913
Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that    37.8398
we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly . "    22.8491
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses .    43.9915
You must not suspect me .    28.9494
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it .    17.1676
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it .    45.8968
She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess .    28.5365
Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room .    15.7503
Good gracious !    26.7136
do any thing rather than marry without affection .    81.4305
Elizabeth said no more - - but her mind could not acquiesce .    28.1457
That he was not a good - tempered man , had been her firmest opinion .    27.5627
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? "    36.2170
The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it .    36.0741
My feelings will not be repressed .    22.5949
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family .    29.1148
" That you certainly shall . "    40.2856
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy .    42.7813
He comes down on Thursday at the latest , very likely on Wednesday .    67.9481
" You are over scrupulous surely .    51.9752
" But , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him .    26.2340
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them .    26.7534
" Not that I shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out    23.3528
. "    1.0279
You deserve no such attention .    86.1292
and to see dear Wickham too !    502.7818
She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down .    22.4031
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ?    51.6521
where , where is my uncle ? "    50.7591
" It was a subject which they could not mention before me . "    24.3323
He was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it .    25.2360
" Oh , no ! "    22.0068
" Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . "    55.8130
If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your    32.1831
hands in the course of the morning .    9.8344
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word .    85.1025
Hurst . "    3.6700
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust . - - How humiliating is this discovery ! - - Yet , how just a humiliation ! - - Had I been in love , I could    35.5583
not have been more wretchedly blind .    36.4136
I am impatient to see him . "    6.9673
" Then , who taught you ?    85.1645
You alluded to something else .    84.0275
It was to this effect : " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you - - be assured that we are all well .    53.7185
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ?    56.4164
Not a soul knew of it , but Col . and Mrs . Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked !    32.8616
Nobody can tell what I suffer ! - - But it is always so .    23.3856
Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object .    22.3352
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart .    52.6701
And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon .    58.2434
" No - - why should he ?    42.4462
Her colour changed , and she said no more .    26.5697
We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .    61.2448
we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! "    71.0658
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . "    38.2736
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; Oxford , Blenheim , Warwick , Kenelworth , Birmingham , & c . are sufficiently known .    44.1345
My mind was more agreeably engaged .    35.1050
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this .    19.7849
" How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year !    51.0532
But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation . "    22.5596
My father was not only fond of this young man's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it .    30.9652
From herself to Jane - - from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr . Darcy's explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again .    43.3032
" The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . "    55.6002
" No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . "    16.7793
I cannot do justice to his kindness .    63.3056
Mr . Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party .    20.8259
Mr . Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia .    42.5922
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together .    27.4752
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart .    43.7316
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind .    31.6176
" What think you of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ? "    19.8139
For such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve    31.7328
her from falling an easy prey .    188.1403
You give me fresh life and vigour .    68.0147
Kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy .    53.2175
' Ah !    31.3682
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement .    42.4843
" How strange this is !    73.4942
I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately .    33.0814
It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention .    32.6340
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .    26.7049
An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter    32.9588
space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn .    16.1799
" And they must marry !    79.0041
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic .    65.0744
Your's , & c . " EDW .    5.8371
It is unaccountable !    20.7623
I enquired after their brother , of course .    38.9099
Shall you like to have such a brother ? "    19.8777
While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr . Darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes    33.2585
to predominate , she began to regret that he came .    24.1039
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with .    46.8714
" Well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ?    16.6564
" Are you quite sure , Ma'am ? - - is not there a little mistake ? "    35.2598
Collins . "    3.6234
" I know them a little .    47.3226
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .    36.0793
" Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . - - Will you hear it ? "    35.5850
Who would have thought it !    27.2729
I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs .    21.8759
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace .    64.6757
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above .    42.1604
Mr . Darcy danced only once with Mrs . Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party .    24.8461
Mrs . Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well .    32.8856
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . - - Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own    34.1791
, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .    117.6183
That lady I suppose is your mother . "    38.5940
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham .    29.0283
But I confess they would have no charms for me .    24.3810
" Oh !    5.3941
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .    37.4316
I am sure you must feel it so . "    9.6801
I do not trust my own partiality .    37.5981
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense .    53.0141
dear , yes ; - - but you must own she is very plain .    48.9289
" And men take care that they should . "    70.8086
Seriously , I would have you be on your guard .    29.9154
But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one    37.9667
, had been scarcely ever clouded .    75.6599
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . "    61.4215
" You judge very properly , " said Mr . Bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy .    27.9922
I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F . is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W . was not a man to be trusted .    43.8956
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia .    79.4133
" Miss Bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with .    23.8245
" I confess , " said he , " that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings .    25.4052
Thursday was to be the wedding day , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room    47.1087
.    N/A
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs . Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that    47.4174
he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .    123.1175
Perhaps she is full young to be much in company .    86.1481
But I have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest - tempered , most generous - hearted , boy in the world . "    40.2603
Mrs . Bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . - - But their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see    38.0685
them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle .    52.6710
" Books - - Oh !    23.4312
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange .    46.3638
" Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer .    41.8255
My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ?    55.1185
" How can you talk so ? "    17.0646
Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .    49.4655
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the    36.4246
Park , hurried home with the great intelligence .    68.5897
Her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , much    40.5459
more than to any other person in the room .    12.3324
" This is an evening of wonders , indeed !    52.5743
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .    73.3066
Elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time    64.5231
was now come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them .    40.2614
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her    52.9389
voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . "    57.5160
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile .    36.0559
But I suppose you had no opportunity .    24.3075
my dear , " continued Mrs . Bennet , " I am quite delighted with him .    8.9951
" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . - - No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection .    32.7814
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr . Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could    65.4087
satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .    37.2080
Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer .    27.6232
But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "    31.1246
He walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; Charlotte tried to console her .    56.6819
They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved .    78.2581
Elizabeth privately added , " And how much I shall have to conceal . "    25.0944
A lady's imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment .    77.8949
He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy .    45.6436
But are you pleased , Jane ?    100.1132
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford .    37.3634
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room .    34.1675
said Elizabeth .    6.7467
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon .    54.8125
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement .    37.9112
And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much .    36.7004
cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared .    22.5150
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken - - or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .    27.1821
" It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began .    47.7080
We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his    45.9269
being what he is .    96.7581
It drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present .    36.0525
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to Rosings .    25.2082
Darcy ? "    8.1311
Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness .    36.4145
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs . Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .    54.7520
Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .    78.5380
I believe I have now told you every thing .    31.9553
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of Mr . Darcy , she could not but allow that Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive    57.5939
as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust    57.2388
- - any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits .    99.2656
" Does that young lady know Mr .    60.6089
You know not what you are about . "    15.1093
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his    101.9729
attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .    105.7863
Mr . Wickham had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight .    20.6000
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him .    60.0912
But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph .    31.6688
" You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr .    67.6315
" May I ask to what these questions tend ? "    65.5756
She could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on .    49.2132
But these things happen so often !    170.5426
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this    57.5397
land . "    14.6674
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others .    83.3605
But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . -    47.3088
- That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , - - but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears . - - I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it    50.3098
; - - I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . - - My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in    58.9240
my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . - - But there were other causes of repugnance ; - - causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both    55.6969
instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . - - These causes must be stated , though briefly . - - The situation of your mother's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of    45.8484
propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father . - - Pardon me . - - It pains me to offend you .    47.3284
These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber .    58.4026
And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply .    119.4440
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . "    57.7986
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .    44.5434
Mr . Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him .    31.0203
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received !    59.9232
He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . "    50.1440
" There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , - - Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your    35.6620
acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? "    40.4076
This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . "    43.7520
What could be the meaning of it ? - - It was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know .    27.0461
" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me .    16.8719
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without    40.5024
offering one argument in favour of its propriety . "    34.8786
In the absence of Jane , he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of relief .    40.7207
Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "    23.4213
Unfeeling , selfish girl !    56.3877
And when I returned home , the - - - - shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time .    26.6454
Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs . Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove .    42.3327
I do not know who is good enough for him . "    14.7539
to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing .    46.6874
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture .    62.0466
Mr . Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , - - " This walk is not wide enough for our party .    53.5605
I did not think Mrs . Gardiner was so little to be trusted . "    16.1078
Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied .    66.4295
What do you keep winking at me for ?    64.4085
" And this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection !    26.2175
Thank Heaven !    29.6002
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations .    51.7446
The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .    19.4763
" Most willingly . "    65.8445
" That is very strange .    13.1628
Mr . Darcy is engaged to my daughter .    15.1938
Yes , yes .    22.0341
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . "    27.6689
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her . - - Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr . Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety    39.1628
in a different manner . - - I am excessively attentive to all those things .    25.3558
How is half such a sum to be repaid ? "    41.8649
At length , she spoke again .    21.7176
She shared in their attendance on Mrs . Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .    27.5663
I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off .    55.9968
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , Mr . Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden    35.7718
, which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .    50.5876
" They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . "    36.6587
You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say .    28.4730
He should be particularly happy at any time , & c . & c . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them .    26.5364
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her .    21.5250
" It is evident by this , " added Jane , " that he comes back no more this winter . "    18.4142
" That is right . - - You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine .    31.3965
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . - - Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .    47.8708
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a    35.5805
week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice .    28.4040
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . "    37.5352
replied Kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .    78.6549
cried Elizabeth .    4.2699
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better .    66.1872
Darcy ? "    8.1311
Mr . Bennet protested against any description of finery .    38.3990
She could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man .    55.1425
He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .    86.7373
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs . Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should    53.2079
be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them .    54.1692
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it .    26.2360
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance .    67.9294
" Yes , Sir , I know I am .    22.4422
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . "    29.9709
" Oh !    5.3941
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer    32.3287
.    N/A
Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .    47.9805
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression .    19.5172
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while .    105.3999
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . "    36.2306
But pride - - where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation . "    32.9326
Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William's too long .    89.0177
Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , " Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully .    39.4102
They all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses .    57.6731
She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all .    31.9813
" The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other .    55.8221
If he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make    57.9226
him .    59.1455
" Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? "    54.7272
" I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before .    41.2359
The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle ,    38.8696
and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport .    77.8250
The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .    60.0674
" And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . "    30.1059
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share .    53.8915
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .    70.2470
That tall , proud man . "    65.4114
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys .    25.2840
* * * * * The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased Mrs . Bennet's curiosity ; and Elizabeth    23.0186
was spared from much teazing on the subject .    41.9416
Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to    43.8017
herself , she was very little disposed to approve them .    21.3827
dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered .    28.2765
No , no - - I feel he may defy us there .    40.9725
It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit .    40.2627
Lydia , my love , ring the bell .    52.0357
" Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ?    32.1147
Dear , dear Lizzy .    29.5915
" He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them .    32.6646
and so did Mrs . Forster .    108.0129
Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family .    13.2389
To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little Theatre was open .    117.9447
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " Ah !    60.4621
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . - - But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . - - To convince him , therefore , that he    42.9860
had deceived himself , was no very difficult point .    110.8315
It is because he will not give himself the trouble . "    26.4021
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .    68.1324
What a contrast between him and his friend !    36.0647
" I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . "    53.6059
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the head quarters .    37.6843
The little Gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself    24.9599
over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome .    37.7461
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite congratulation ; Mr . Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation .    41.6551
I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend , WILLIAM COLLINS . "    71.0498
I want to talk very seriously .    57.2736
" If I had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her .    27.7962
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .    34.9150
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . "    28.9426
Mr . Bingley was good looking and gentleman - like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners .    50.4429
said Mrs . Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .    32.8622
" And we mean to treat you all , " added Lydia ; " but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . "    37.7551
Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? "    13.5711
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved .    133.1296
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her .    92.7460
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful . "    35.7949
Women fancy admiration means more than it does . "    71.1158
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton .    37.6763
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage .    56.7690
" I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .    38.5747
what felicity !    478.7958
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted .    30.1518
" Yes , very indifferent indeed , " said Elizabeth , laughingly .    19.2653
We seem to have been designed for each other . "    15.8939
" And have you answered the letter ? "    21.0962
We want none of them ; do we ? "    78.8232
Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . "    54.5864
Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .    56.3573
I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent .    41.6010
" Oh !    5.3941
With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms .    25.9156
She did not fear her father's opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets    40.4920
in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile .    28.7520
Why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ?    49.8234
But I must write no more .    23.1125
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son - in - law . "    39.4573
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion .    33.5639
" You write uncommonly fast . "    54.4366
" We will go as far as Meryton with you , " said Catherine and Lydia . - - Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .    37.3323
Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth .    14.1427
" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? "    17.5305
With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining - parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee .    22.6162
It was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .    58.0928
If Mr . Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ?    60.8687
I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at .    60.3192
" Not as you represent it .    31.4509
" Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , " said Mr . Collins very gravely - - " but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you .    24.9858
" Really , Mr . Collins , " cried Elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly .    15.6084
Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? "    62.3783
I will speak to her about it myself directly .    59.9171
" I am not now to learn , " replied Mr . Collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for    30.2548
their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time .    108.9739
Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself .    19.3748
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .    51.9411
Ever since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it .    34.2710
He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney - coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom .    73.4987
She dared not relate the other half of Mr . Darcy's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend .    25.7376
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying .    38.5188
To know that her daughter would be married was enough .    24.2893
" It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . "    42.1161
He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex .    36.1405
He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . "    28.6001
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs . Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly    30.0337
as possible .    27.5700
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr . Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday .    35.7555
With them he is remarkably agreeable . "    49.6737
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence .    104.6644
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming .    33.6795
The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty - seven , was Elizabeth's intimate friend .    59.1941
" I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . "    23.9025
But I knew not - - I was afraid of doing too much .    17.5459
' Tis as good as a Lord !    23.7268
As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents .    93.5499
I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . "    28.3344
Her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and    38.4927
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity .    24.7166
" Mr . Darcy is not to be laughed at ! "    21.0774
" If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence    33.6030
of his own .    33.6917
Mrs . Bennet could hardly comprehend it .    11.4191
but from what the report of their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley , and her being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of    43.0582
one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea .    74.9621
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth .    25.9789
" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?    43.7373
Console Lady Catherine as well as you can .    21.5430
" Very true , indeed ; - - and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? - - Do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to    37.4084
think ill of somebody . "    25.3980
Your tempers are by no means unlike .    41.4119
But if I go on , I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem .    48.9181
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's , and instructed her as to    42.0387
the care of her cows and her poultry .    64.4486
" My object then , " replied Darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by    42.0112
letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to .    41.9470
" No governess !    72.6509
On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks .    50.7220
But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be    58.5196
in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . "    12.1463
I am sure you will be very comfortable there .    12.3729
" That is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily .    52.6183
Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her .    23.9488
Their manners are not equal to his . "    30.9807
" Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . "    46.6776
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .    31.4948
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was .    154.4550
Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it .    21.9904
It was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter - day , almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival , that they were    30.6899
honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .    49.0035
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .    87.9015
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .    91.2559
Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of - - or I may say , three very silly sisters .    49.2345
" How can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt !    19.2007
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge , and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed .    43.4966
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it .    41.2010
She had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in    45.6840
exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .    20.8936
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance .    106.2285
This , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal ; and it was settled that Mr . Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better .    30.9181
If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents .    51.9797
They crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and    69.2480
a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered it .    81.2667
Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote .    51.0057
Such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude - - for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no    59.1217
means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .    22.2348
Why does she not come in ? "    124.2116
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose .    54.2145
" As often as I can .    76.3190
How was that possible ?    217.0066
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together .    69.6997
Darcy , as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .    35.1653
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; and in the evening Mrs . Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter .    37.9594
" Well , " cried Elizabeth , " have it as you choose .    15.4388
This cannot be ! - - engaged to Mr . Darcy !    20.5720
Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction    41.1462
, though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .    28.0562
" You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound .    45.3006
If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment .    27.1906
" True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room .    39.6440
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too !    193.5579
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again .    59.2805
Not that I mean to find fault with you , for such things I know are all chance in this world .    40.4483
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .    22.7811
" That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance .    39.5338
Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it .    28.3627
When Mr . Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte .    50.7374
One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . "    22.2146
" True , " said Mr . Bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . "    26.7173
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .    61.0676
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked .    26.0609
But I know the foundation is unjust .    74.1204
Let me do it without farther loss of time .    77.9021
Elizabeth made no answer .    4.9480
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .    32.9504
" I often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends .    30.7499
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . "    26.4539
However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves . "    30.1488
Mr . Hurst looked at her with astonishment .    15.0467
The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . "    53.1692
" Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .    44.0519
Within doors there was Lady Catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the Parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the    30.5677
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .    107.9804
" Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections .    42.9164
When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .    48.8139
Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .    47.9830
" You are joking , Lizzy .    25.2811
" In what an amiable light does this place him ! "    105.8779
" Oh !    5.3941
Nobody wants him to come .    39.9461
You must and shall be married by a special licence .    54.1809
" Oh !    5.3941
His belief of her sister's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice .    42.0271
Their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty might in time regain her natural    69.8679
degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place    48.4249
and a camp .    231.9782
" It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of .    47.1068
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr . Collins , in describing the civility of Mr . and Mrs . Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at    33.5263
whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House .    45.0528
If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed .    49.8192
" I admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed Mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . "    42.0079
But I dare not hope it .    29.9465
I saw them the night before last . "    33.7582
my dear , " cried his wife , " I cannot bear to hear that mentioned .    14.3210
But , alas !    44.4777
She was teazed by Mr . Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others .    19.9421
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .    106.2206
" Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? "    58.2826
You have no compassion on my poor nerves . "    23.6609
Lady Catherine was generally speaking - - stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself .    43.2176
Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Mr . Gardiner's house , where they were to remain a few days .    31.5731
She followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly !    51.5354
Mrs . Wickham !    19.1099
said he , smiling .    37.4713
On distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .    29.9368
It is almost past belief .    134.9253
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country .    39.6506
" About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .    47.1003
It was a rational scheme to be sure !    37.5447
Mr . Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .    48.9960
You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr . Bingley might like you the best of the party . "    36.2592
She answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .    48.9585
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . "    29.1689
It was a large , well - proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .    39.2051
" I think she will .    50.5836
I cannot think of it without abhorrence . "    20.1081
" You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner - - in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion .    41.7483
" Where is your sister ? "    20.5169
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . "    49.7904
I quite forgot !    292.8914
What relates to yourself , is as follows .    37.7323
Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it .    36.4254
No , no , you shall not deceive me .    28.1492
She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Mr . Hurst had a house .    44.9529
If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer .    31.7364
They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs , and    34.9085
in a moment he entered the room .    18.0612
yes - - it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again .    43.7451
" Very true ; and if I had my will , we should .    33.7113
" There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men .    44.7254
The vicious propensities - - the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded    27.3722
moments , which Mr . Darcy could not have .    13.9280
Mrs . Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me ?    54.1995
" Good gracious !    29.8036
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here .    83.5487
" I beg your pardon , " replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a sneer .    18.6321
Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare .    78.7825
Her mind was less difficult to develope .    30.3897
As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had    52.4911
of him , should then be overthrown ?    98.0982
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking .    84.8257
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . - - These are the kind of little things    36.4238
which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . "    31.1451
My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . "    52.2279
But enough of this .    127.7858
I never saw such a long chin in my life .    25.4963
But it is all , all too late now . "    41.9228
" No - - I cannot talk of books in a ball - room ; my head is always full of something else . "    26.2352
" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! "    38.5292
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .    103.7535
" By all means , " cried Bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of .    41.2284
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle - piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long .    32.6214
I congratulate her .    28.4780
Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do .    31.9495
I shall like it of all things .    31.5220
Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr . Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power . - - Elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and    37.2656
all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled .    74.7327
What could your ladyship propose by it ? "    43.6566
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims .    29.5574
When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr . Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent .    32.1137
I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it .    53.6723
His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured .    51.3619
" I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied .    38.3581
cried Jane .    12.3672
" And do you like her ? "    16.6653
She finds Miss Pope a treasure .    146.1512
Mrs . Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight , when she should enter the room .    27.1744
Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not . "    13.4663
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained .    62.6425
He looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at Pemberley .    19.6519
" Indeed , " replied Elizabeth , " I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me .    21.4507
Must it be so ? "    44.6757
Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged .    37.7147
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ?    61.8754
Those who do not complain are never pitied . "    61.5101
At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable .    23.7448
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . "    29.9687
- - said Jane faintly smiling , - - " You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . "    24.7137
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ?    37.6231
" You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr . Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet .    15.5012
Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .    24.3250
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's .    45.7750
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants .    16.8711
But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most .    67.0679
How I long to see her !    75.3226
As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .    35.0964
Sir William only smiled .    24.2073
Well , he is a very undeserving young man - - and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now .    26.7759
In understanding Darcy was the superior .    69.6838
This he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed .    54.8899
" Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself .    10.4278
Elizabeth was forced to go .    17.3400
Mr . Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family ; Jane heard them with horror .    47.3654
no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .    122.6320
Mr . Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her .    57.8040
I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , I am thus rejected .    91.2080
" Hate you !    66.1439
" I do not blame Jane , " she continued , " for Jane would have got Mr . Bingley , if she could .    18.7200
You dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes ,    47.6899
and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . "    37.9005
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? - -    85.8830
Mr .    1.0050
You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . "    29.9753
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was    33.4715
such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough .    41.3144
Mr . Bingley arrived .    16.4285
Yet he knew to the contrary himself .    39.6735
" Well , Lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ?    43.0985
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me .    61.5736
A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago .    73.8329
He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on .    31.7586
She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham .    42.1451
" This is not to be borne .    20.4008
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy .    19.5883
" It did .    62.8704
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies .    41.4184
It is Mr . Bingley I am sure .    15.1355
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected .    34.5860
" Do let us have a little music , " - - cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . - - " Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr .    27.7310
How you must have hated me after that evening ? "    40.4480
" Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .    53.6119
Though Mr . Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage .    18.8926
" No , my dear ; I think not .    22.1667
Bennet . "    4.4749
Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley's friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me .    70.6087
I thought I should have died .    46.7484
It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice - - a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .    54.7496
" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . "    37.9602
His character was to speak for itself .    56.6269
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to    34.7122
her before .    1932.4568
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible    56.1725
.    N/A
" Not one . "    30.2901
As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister .    42.5332
He could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .    45.4100
But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . "    27.3395
Your idea of the ponies is delightful .    27.8168
These recollections will not do at all .    18.5430
" I am sorry it went off .    26.4639
Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street .    35.6162
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . "    25.8035
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ?    211.6888
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .    53.0914
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself    61.1908
. "    1.0279
Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? - - A glass of wine ; - - shall I get you one ? - - You are very ill . " " No , I thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to    36.0802
recover herself .    26.3860
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr . Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary .    54.3029
" Yes , Ma'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him - - just as affable to the poor . "    32.9768
But I hope you will not mind it : it is all for Jane's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then .    29.8514
It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .    24.9973
" I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women .    141.6423
He was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .    37.9769
" And they are really to be married ! "    21.2681
His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .    42.4766
Accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer .    39.4793
Kitty , run down and order the carriage .    67.2689
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin .    35.6378
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham .    52.8819
" I comfort myself with thinking , " replied Jane , " that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .    23.9263
Sir William did not say much .    15.1259
I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .    49.2693
" There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law .    52.5146
She replied in the affirmative .    100.0244
" Good gracious ! "    12.8722
In his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke    56.2588
her .    4340.3057
then - - some time or other we shall be happy to hear you .    40.2820
It was really a very handsome thought .    57.5219
" An excellent consolation in its way , " said Elizabeth , " but it will not do for us .    14.1692
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .    33.0296
About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged .    31.6907
" This fine account of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . "    26.7311
" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on .    30.6086
But make a virtue of it by all means .    75.1609
" But my father cannot . - - He wrote last week to hurry my return . "    42.5877
But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . "    22.2070
The evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary .    55.9952
She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished .    53.4058
" There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . "    60.7734
It mortifies me .    73.8432
Mrs . Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed .    46.7434
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .    46.3079
" You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate . "    31.4112
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into    73.3324
it ? "    22.9641
If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . "    25.6611
" It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire .    20.4206
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again .    68.3918
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been    31.4401
well assured of his cousin's corroboration .    58.3344
She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body .    32.1922
But this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the room .    33.6294
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr . Darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .    31.0084
He then handed her in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings .    41.4278
" Yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation !    53.5315
His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr . Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate    63.9405
pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .    22.5938
One day's delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .    47.4046
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .    24.2125
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .    52.6760
what hours of transport we shall spend !    132.5013
I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk .    40.5448
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy !    15.8237
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr . Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr . Bingley's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper    30.8174
to join in the evening's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance .    33.2743
In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach .    52.8264
" My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners - - my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not .    54.3245
I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer .    80.7922
" Mr . Darcy , you see , is the man !    35.3129
It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .    64.2350
" One of them does . "    67.8376
When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister - in - law of the card - table - - but in vain .    37.9610
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Mr . Collins .    40.3516
Charles , when you build your house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . "    31.0940
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him .    36.6927
Darcy ! "    5.3275
Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .    38.5067
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is .    46.4017
She was overpowered by shame and vexation .    21.1425
" Yours , & c . " As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind .    48.4714
Mr . and Mrs . Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys - - and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . "    53.1934
But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity .    47.3396
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . "    20.2009
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister    115.3607
.    N/A
But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . "    60.1617
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr . Wickham's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice .    58.0301
" You shall have it in few words .    64.8491
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs . Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her    47.0641
from Netherfield .    66.5283
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt .    60.7166
Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body . "    63.9471
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit    34.9001
of greater importance .    125.2790
" To - morrow fortnight . "    50.2099
" To yield readily - - easily - - to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you . "    62.1614
but the gentlemen will have Mr . Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton ; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . "    28.4544
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all    33.9663
to dine with her .    23.6226
A great deal more passed at the other table .    26.9404
" You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time .    50.2239
" I cannot make him out . - - There is something very pompous in his style . - - And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ? - - We cannot suppose he would help it , if he could . -    37.6983
- Can he be a sensible man , sir ? "    67.4524
They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane's perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all    33.2089
his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super - excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .    51.4334
She comes to us to - day .    60.6724
A most delightful place ! - - Excellent Parsonage House !    89.7571
" If !    159.3996
On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting - room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who    45.9453
had taken a liking to the room , when last at Pemberley .    32.7668
" No .    51.7250
She was engaged one day as she walked , in re - perusing Jane's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up    47.9279
that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .    55.6053
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention .    26.1463
Did you see it ? "    11.1297
His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him .    77.4554
" And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently .    26.9064
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . "    30.1862
" They will join me early to - morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , - - Mr . Bingley and his sisters . "    27.5557
One morning , about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining - room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and    29.2619
they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .    51.3683
Elizabeth made no objection ; - - the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off .    22.2395
And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece's .    55.0125
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .    61.2060
In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .    56.1700
" I never saw any one so shocked .    31.2876
" I cannot see why Mrs . Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , " said she , " though I am not her particular friend .    21.5236
" I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did .    40.9887
The officer was the very Mr . Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed .    62.9846
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . "    49.9140
Nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them .    46.2408
At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing .    38.4599
who could have done less for her ?    48.6892
- - and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again .    29.8041
Yet he is such a man ! "    9.7755
" Nearly three weeks . "    39.7608
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .    133.9559
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . Gardiner's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him .    37.5930
I must conclude , for I cannot be long from my poor mother .    42.0355
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her .    45.7821
My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ; - - most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education .    38.5256
GARDINER . "    1.3058
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life .    25.7298
She has two nieces of her own .    41.5340
Elizabeth was distressed .    35.8746
Mr . Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him    27.3699
.    N/A
He cannot know what Mr . Darcy is . "    11.5869
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . "    26.4123
I am afraid you will be angry . "    10.8245
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .    52.1167
Adieu to disappointment and spleen .    59.7242
When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered    29.8446
a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer .    44.4774
He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent .    69.3181
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter .    33.3830
Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her .    37.9524
" Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried Colonel Fitzwilliam .    31.7104
" Not at all . "    15.3427
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so    45.9403
lost to every thing ? - - Impossible .    21.9639
We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , - - only think what fun !    100.1443
Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . "    22.5347
Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs . Bennet give up the point .    31.4651
He stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away .    26.7467
But it is so strange ! "    13.2272
Bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .    32.6135
And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .    38.6303
Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card - table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest sister , to observe    29.3516
the game .    266.8336
You do not look well .    18.9944
He took the hint , and soon began with , " This seems a very comfortable house .    52.8301
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject .    24.6718
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him .    56.7462
Every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch .    47.6718
Between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard .    89.8219
Respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .    66.2852
" Merely to the illustration of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity .    30.2435
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .    36.4180
" On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago .    32.4839
I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . "    26.5762
It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both - - - - " " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! "    24.0728
Mrs . Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party .    43.9606
" What is there of good to be expected ? "    55.5466
It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her .    34.7168
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again .    35.4681
As for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " This is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of .    55.8106
Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he    39.2497
was by her .    195.4125
A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and Mrs . Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter .    42.1753
and having to relate such a thing of his sister !    69.8408
And gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth called out , " Dear Ma'am , do not go . - - I beg you will not go . - - Mr .    25.5286
Then addressing her daughter , " Oh !    27.4739
Did he know of their intending to go off ?    73.7626
He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently    54.5674
meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce .    100.2750
" You are too hasty , Sir , " she cried .    28.5263
Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed .    31.8897
Miss Darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .    33.2542
" You observed it , Mr . Darcy , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley ; " and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition . "    12.7565
" If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . "    32.6324
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil .    155.0917
Jane's is nothing to it - - nothing at all .    66.9748
The officers may not be so pleasant in General - - - - ' s regiment . "    23.5321
But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief .    53.2302
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable .    46.8872
What will become of me .    43.6750
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever .    121.7625
It cannot last long .    219.8229
Jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from Caroline .    49.4912
" After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin    32.8868
, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match .    52.1875
The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .    56.7865
I can recal nothing worse .    85.4993
" What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ?    22.4678
Mr . Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other .    24.4427
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . "    30.6873
" What , none of you ? "    35.7197
My dear , dear Lydia ! - - How merry we shall be together when we meet ! "    24.7673
Compliments always take you by surprise , and me never .    66.9501
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair .    61.6200
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! "    35.2310
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom    39.2878
he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .    49.2459
" I found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr . Darcy ; - - that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more    28.7775
than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . "    32.8744
Each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr . Bingley's friend , without being heard by either of them .    22.9366
Collins must excuse me . - - He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear .    21.9139
It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .    22.4078
But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me .    33.5793
" Your affectionate friend , " LYDIA BENNET . "    31.3565
" Do you prefer reading to cards ? "    58.8700
He has the promise of an ensigncy in General - - - - ' s regiment , now quartered in the North .    25.3936
Yours ever , " CAROLINE BINGLEY . "    54.7893
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were    37.9677
some of the most uncomfortable of her life .    24.0946
" It is more than I engage for , I assure you . "    19.0332
I always said it must be so , at last .    43.3546
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone .    52.3244
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune . "    43.6990
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town .    27.9791
With assumed tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success .    25.2297
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger .    35.5449
Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self - consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the    43.0722
success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings .    46.7509
" I can answer your question , " said Fitzwilliam , " without applying to him .    26.3396
that abominable Mr .    64.2769
Wickham only shook his head .    45.1797
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to Mr . Darcy were    42.5799
by no means over .    13.8560
I quite detest the man . "    49.5310
Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence .    36.2262
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter .    28.6696
" I never heard any thing so abominable .    23.1189
" At four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman , " said Mr . Bennet , as he folded up the letter .    30.3727
Consider Mr . Collins's respectability , and Charlotte's prudent , steady character .    34.4746
I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her .    69.6328
She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns .    53.5215
Darcy . "    4.6842
A house in town !    44.1129
" And may I ask ? "    30.9161
I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . "    39.2469
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased .    48.8864
Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented .    32.8986
She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend .    40.8557
His apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .    44.6033
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends .    49.1519
" Yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing .    39.4394
Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family !    33.0480
" Would Mr . Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? "    44.8231
Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them .    44.2970
" But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . "    35.9860
Their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses ' reach .    62.9730
They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered .    49.4854
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted    32.7544
.    N/A
" The country , " said Darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study .    48.9019
She wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject .    41.7412
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them .    37.7202
" I did not think you would ; - - and that being the case , I cannot consider your situation with much compassion . "    30.4640
But why Mr . Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult to understand .    28.6591
Teazing , teazing , man !    161.6686
I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . "    18.2312
" But what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? - - what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? "    22.6290
I did for you .    119.2391
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections .    51.1023
" How I long to see her again !    51.3756
" I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , - - and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .    30.4416
Mr . Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them .    32.2949
He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her .    31.5657
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere .    59.6717
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . "    22.4601
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required .    46.8735
" In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere .    35.3490
what does he say ?    55.8418
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater - - what shall I call it ?    38.9661
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain .    35.2835
Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . '    31.0003
" Certainly .    56.5074
" But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? "    32.3819
Mrs . Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , " May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr . and Mrs . Collins well . "    26.0705
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night . "    24.6145
It is impossible that he should still love me . "    26.5083
Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal !    49.2618
Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters .    35.9818
Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage .    38.7113
" Oh , lord !    17.8593
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy's    27.0592
looks and behaviour .    71.5308
" Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said Darcy , " has too much truth .    30.5025
Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . Collins first came to Hunsford . "    18.0470
" Mr . Bingley does not know Mr . Wickham himself ? "    11.3276
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .    34.6271
" You have .    60.2337
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence .    60.0670
They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself .    26.2467
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a    41.8245
most scandalous falsehood .    61.2197
" That is as it happens .    31.3634
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .    89.4364
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words .    25.3381
" If I were as rich as Mr . Darcy , " cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters , " I should not care how proud I was .    33.1993
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . "    30.1802
But she is nothing to me now .    21.1692
are quite well . "    8.6726
But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited .    59.8924
" But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for .    19.3026
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference .    33.7599
Mr . Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr . Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself .    40.0804
Poor Jane !    48.6105
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . "    46.3854
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .    37.4105
Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose him . "    25.0884
In the dining - room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before .    34.4230
He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped .    36.8069
It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought    38.3225
to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning .    20.6734
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week .    50.0844
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse .    42.7854
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted .    59.3318
She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since    57.1255
she had been there .    38.1141
Believe her to be deceived by all means .    27.6874
Their table was superlatively stupid .    76.3282
Jane was not happy .    24.5855
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . "    60.5303
Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I was uncivil ?    73.3933
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him .    38.2301
Now and then , they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .    48.2643
Well , well , I only hope it will last .    51.5037
They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering .    63.5716
" Oh !    5.3941
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance .    94.3931
Her report was highly favourable .    100.1849
They now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought .    148.4649
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .    37.0047
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball .    38.7944
Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were .    37.8905
In the former were many good paintings ; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting ,    51.0373
and also more intelligible .    157.4525
" Insolent girl ! "    39.5318
" When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other . "    28.4761
" Yes , " replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but that was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . "    34.9308
After an affectionate parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr . Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had    29.0038
received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner , though unknown .    17.2176
" In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either .    33.4966
" And this , " cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me !    27.4275
the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! "    75.6031
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . "    10.5108
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman .    98.6120
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .    37.0373
" It is a long time , Mr . Bingley , since you went away , " said Mrs . Bennet .    10.3316
Mrs . Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr . Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at    35.1810
home .    11.6957
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was .    42.0725
Mr . Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain .    55.1873
" Yes - - that is what makes it amusing .    48.5074
All field sports were over .    56.2146
I hardly know how Mr . Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . "    36.8950
" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . "    35.4132
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr . Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr . Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he    29.8063
found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her .    56.5895
I know it to be impossible . "    12.1144
I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .    55.4887
Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation .    42.8166
She could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present .    73.3934
Mr . Bennet could not have chosen better .    14.1146
Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable - - that one false step involves her    70.8570
in endless ruin - - that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , - - and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . "    33.6186
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .    29.7765
Mr . Wickham began to speak on more general topics , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .    62.3834
No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; - - a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against    60.4937
them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .    34.8628
There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .    47.1460
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty .    46.5594
" And yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them . "    23.8832
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she    64.0035
was .    8593.4775
" Very well . - - That reply will do for the present . - - Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . - - But now we may be silent . "    37.7854
Bingley ? "    13.2285
His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile .    22.8710
" Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . "    39.3522
Mr . Jones says we must not think of moving her .    48.7350
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .    30.6424
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference    47.7320
towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .    59.6689
" Oh !    5.3941
We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . "    22.0273
" To be sure , Lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance , for his features are perfectly good .    27.0657
He knows where we live .    191.1917
I send no compliments to your mother .    35.5126
" We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; " said her mother as soon as she was in the hall .    24.3816
" Certainly not . "    28.3486
" Well , Lizzy , " said Mrs . Bennet one day , " what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane's ?    22.6051
He was silent .    23.6737
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully .    22.8409
All loveliness and goodness as she is !    54.2606
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! "    45.1680
But papa is so disagreeable . "    31.5470
" You have insulted me , in every possible method .    26.9846
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr . Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to    37.9377
love .    41.0645
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .    46.2426
" Indeed I am .    30.5837
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do .    62.8430
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being .    47.4018
From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them .    36.7155
But I will not repine .    16.9825
Why must their marriage be private ?    247.5731
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her    53.7443
spirits , by all that affection could do .    41.0839
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr . Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday and Monday , endurable    44.3382
to Kitty and Lydia .    39.5896
When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room .    23.2213
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield .    102.8398
One seems so forlorn without them . "    68.0282
he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . "    46.1886
I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me .    98.0601
" I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . "    21.7506
My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister's partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call    64.9082
Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart .    105.0803
" She is a very good kind of girl , I believe .    16.8412
But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties . "    104.7184
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .    44.2176
Not these two or three years perhaps . "    29.8170
" I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr . Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him .    33.9796
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit .    58.9547
" Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr . Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ?    50.1476
" It will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said Miss Lucas .    28.3713
Mrs . Bennet was quite in the fidgets .    12.6392
Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think    53.5507
as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . "    28.4338
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . "    103.3402
" I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire .    46.7527
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .    56.0987
Mrs . Bennet's best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer .    25.9180
Secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly - - which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness    45.1568
.    N/A
" And what did she say ? "    26.9011
She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years .    53.0818
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it .    24.0709
" What an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut .    35.0283
I will try again .    114.1275
His understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes .    38.7859
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . "    28.5894
" Are you not diverted ? "    26.9634
She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .    52.0378
He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all .    52.7391
Elizabeth silently attended her .    120.6958
" Implacable resentment is a shade in a character .    80.4915
" My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me .    39.7573
Mrs . Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .    36.6915
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ?    62.8760
She was very equal therefore to address Mr . Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .    26.9464
There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .    28.9848
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . "    28.8171
She could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self - conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress .    68.6669
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable .    91.0840
Catherine , weak - spirited , irritable , and completely under Lydia's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self - willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing .    58.8711
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .    74.9356
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park , when he put his letter into her hand !    68.5746
" Probably not ; - - but Mr . Darcy can please where he chuses .    38.3761
Mrs . Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .    21.8426
" A thorough , determined dislike of me - - a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy .    62.0974
" Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added Charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . "    30.3149
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted .    47.6361
" Yes ; - - but he seemed to like his second better . "    28.4239
Kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon .    72.1622
