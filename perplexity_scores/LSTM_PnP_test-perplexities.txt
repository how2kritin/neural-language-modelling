206.6954
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks .    254.5037
" Yes .    13.0484
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile .    346.9571
The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt .    70.7590
" Come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared .    53.3810
You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr . Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be .    79.0190
" That is a question which I hardly know how to answer .    45.2034
<UNK> back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write <UNK> .    162.8815
" She is a great deal too ill to be moved .    48.7164
His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it .    69.0981
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise .    124.4942
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane .    95.3299
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances - - and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his <UNK> to myself .    158.5459
Are you going much farther ? "    89.5365
We passed each other several times .    227.3599
" Oh !    6.1638
An <UNK> would do me a great deal of good , I am sure .    49.8870
They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long .    66.3827
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable    110.0389
of a very different <UNK> ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham's so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire .    64.5248
why is not every body as happy ? "    39.5532
In the <UNK> of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to Elizabeth , said , " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . - - I assure you it    67.2287
is very refreshing after sitting so long in one <UNK> . "    543.3127
Elizabeth immediately <UNK> the livery , guessed what it meant , and <UNK> no small degree of surprise to her relations , by <UNK> them with the honour which she expected .    369.9653
Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .    72.8955
To know that she had the power of <UNK> what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as    148.1213
nothing could have <UNK> , but the state of <UNK> in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only    112.1665
grieve her sister farther .    472.0320
It cannot be concealed from any one .    63.7104
Who would have thought of my meeting with - - perhaps - - a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! - - I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am    57.8214
now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .    87.6124
His complexion became pale with anger , and the <UNK> of his mind was visible in every feature .    201.7232
They found Mr . Bennet still up .    79.1225
In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to Mrs . Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong <UNK> .    135.7321
Every kind of pride must <UNK> from the connection .    223.4495
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every <UNK> speech she had ever directed towards him .    732.0125
Her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " There are very few people of whom so much can be said .    98.5415
<UNK> wore a happier aspect .    3073.4053
It was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush .    106.5353
" Our habits of expence make us too <UNK> , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . "    319.3181
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .    50.5393
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur    112.6739
.    N/A
" Oh !    6.1638
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr . Darcy's civility , and above all , of his wishing her    98.9129
to be acquainted with his sister .    34.6001
" What does Mr . Darcy mean , " said she to Charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? "    42.8505
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that <UNK> her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself .    251.4895
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general .    90.8952
" My uncle is to send a servant for us . "    51.8539
And in the wretched state of his own <UNK> , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations , for it had just <UNK> that he had left <UNK> debts behind him , to a very considerable <UNK>    196.3107
.    N/A
" Yes , she did . "    11.2857
" How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr . Darcy , for now they do appear wholly <UNK> . "    126.2608
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , <UNK> at the same time the most <UNK> composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .    166.4572
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who    105.6139
sat opposite to them .    337.9651
It originated in Mrs . Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth's arm <UNK> to her support , and consequently preferred her husband's .    193.6526
If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of <UNK> such a <UNK> as that , it might be of essential consequence .    188.8487
It was then <UNK> in the following manner .    167.7845
" Not at all .    29.3882
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family .    55.4314
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in    85.0341
their Rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of    98.3224
him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself .    57.8063
He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .    62.0790
" I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life - - - - " Mrs . Philips was very thankful for his <UNK> , but could not    43.0620
wait for his reason .    70.5392
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane .    87.6051
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within .    99.8877
" Why will you think so ?    54.7043
He had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it .    49.8970
" That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . "    21.6383
Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .    85.3445
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . "    108.0566
" Oh !    6.1638
It was an earnest , <UNK> <UNK> , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .    273.8635
He had never before supposed that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement .    69.1110
In the hall they parted .    64.3387
" Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one .    85.1874
" I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr . Darcy has no defect .    32.5891
I am most seriously displeased . "    116.2389
That will make <UNK> with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . "    172.0417
The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ; and till the morrow , their going was <UNK> .    174.7941
my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately .    47.2690
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .    94.6719
The old lady is Mrs . Jenkinson , who lives with them .    135.4146
Mrs . <UNK> respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this <UNK> of her knowing her master .    298.2885
" Yet why did he come ? "    53.2857
But your arts and <UNK> may , in a moment of <UNK> , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family .    188.5170
The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .    59.7921
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market - town , where the family did not visit .    128.2854
I will not tell you what it is .    15.6580
" Indeed , <UNK> , you are mistaken , " said Elizabeth , <UNK> for her mother .    51.7275
He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit <UNK> long .    131.4868
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so <UNK> , to receive her and her    115.3740
husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished .    38.5234
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield    74.1009
, which was fixed for the following Tuesday .    133.8410
" <UNK> , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss <UNK> as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in <UNK> library . "    195.8020
But however he did not .    64.5858
But you know married women have never much time for writing .    353.4901
" He likes to have his own way very well , " replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .    40.0876
Lord !    18.8897
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend .    56.3047
<UNK> for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public <UNK> , but I wrote to Mr . Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs . <UNK> was of course removed from her charge .    140.4476
She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .    62.4661
To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . "    124.9094
Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one .    48.7605
The possibility of Mr . Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment    69.5666
was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <UNK> of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " <UNK> to Mr . Collins !    143.2153
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man    91.7625
whom he so justly <UNK> .    1867.2638
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr .    223.4490
Mrs . Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so - - but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of .    61.1867
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart ; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry .    156.6464
" I am talking of <UNK> , Charles . "    88.0469
His fear of her , has always <UNK> , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of <UNK> the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . "    84.0762
He was my <UNK> , and excessively attached to me .    121.4884
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs . Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going .    152.0450
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . "    172.7239
But so they always are .    180.6853
How he lived I know not .    228.1137
Darcy . - - She felt all the perverseness of the <UNK> that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite <UNK> of hers . -    156.9753
- How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! - - Yet it did , and even a third .    139.2454
The other is Miss De Bourgh .    145.3307
She was at least free from the offence of Mr . Darcy's farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak .    155.5228
They will have nothing else to do . "    14.2356
The <UNK> of Rosings Park was their <UNK> on one side .    583.6071
" Dear Lizzy ! "    38.1593
Elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph .    62.7521
A little time therefore . - - I shall certainly try to get the better . "    34.2126
" Oh !    6.1638
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .    264.4600
" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another <UNK> !    206.7336
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr . Collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting <UNK> , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable    125.8020
spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings .    180.1264
" But upon my honour I do not .    61.8061
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want    60.1620
of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his <UNK> friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations .    163.3554
And now <UNK> Mr . Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?    141.6542
oh !    92.9518
Mr . Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary .    70.9922
Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth , soon <UNK> behind , while her sister , <UNK> for <UNK> , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " Oh , <UNK> , what news ?    150.7372
Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? "    91.4068
Mrs . Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . "    12.1281
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? "    220.9902
" <UNK> well .    1190.9989
Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London .    43.1818
They were within twenty <UNK> of each other , and so <UNK> was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight .    107.8795
You must contrive to send somebody .    264.4812
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . "    70.3003
As for their mother , Mr . Collins's letter had done away much of her ill - will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters .    67.7129
I thank you for <UNK> it so fully .    569.5289
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the <UNK> <UNK> her coming so far alone .    370.6419
It <UNK> me , I confess ; - - for certainly , there can be nothing so <UNK> to them as instruction .    157.7874
I should infinitely prefer a book . "    211.5419
I declare I do not know a more <UNK> object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do . "    158.2627
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of    115.9942
her .    19.7016
Jane looked a little <UNK> than usual , but more <UNK> than Elizabeth had expected .    200.0488
" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way .    71.2694
" The first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them .    32.3376
said he ; " that is rather singular . "    73.2390
" Of whom does Jane ever think ill ?    422.6845
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she <UNK> part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her <UNK> manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected    182.1703
with him should have an understanding of the first class . "    127.9032
" His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; " and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . "    82.3570
I pity , though I cannot help blaming her .    84.6349
Its <UNK> depended on others .    4423.1929
Mr . Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be beyond a walk .    76.4598
" These are home questions - - and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many <UNK> of that nature .    142.2747
" Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself . "    177.1763
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her - - a present from my master ; she comes here to - morrow with him . "    122.3212
" His manners are very different from his cousin's . "    74.2088
They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not <UNK> till yesterday morning at eight .    1218.3123
In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and <UNK> .    312.8610
It was drawn at the same time as the other - - about eight years ago . "    55.0001
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .    238.8298
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over    85.8692
, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been <UNK> elsewhere .    128.1884
It cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened .    79.4427
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before .    106.6287
" Yes , madam , " said Mrs . Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine .    23.7233
Mrs . Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them .    76.8340
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this .    178.4369
No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it .    36.5974
But our visitor was very obstinate .    213.0334
I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice .    383.7800
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should <UNK> .    83.2659
What is your own opinion ? "    14.7966
At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting !    64.5072
Mr . Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day .    75.3526
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the <UNK> he had been making , and had even    130.3587
<UNK> to suggest some herself , - - some <UNK> in the <UNK> up stairs .    1101.6893
" I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton . "    32.5272
He shook his head . - - " I wish I could call her amiable .    38.4992
Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word .    31.9379
" I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the <UNK> and public places .    201.0885
" I never saw such a woman .    25.8338
She certainly did not hate him .    54.7894
I can hardly write for laughing .    162.8871
" We can all plague and punish one another .    849.2307
Perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease .    72.8332
Mrs . Bennet was <UNK> in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and <UNK> in her <UNK> that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to    75.8616
; and in the <UNK> happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .    378.3153
" Is my father in town ? "    26.3051
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane .    60.4114
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .    208.3623
Her pale face and <UNK> manner made him <UNK> , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was <UNK> by Lydia's situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .    173.4285
" Oh !    6.1638
I will put on my things in a moment .    85.3103
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her <UNK> letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was <UNK> over .    193.5797
<UNK> Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters    79.6229
out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead .    13.4390
<UNK> nature is so <UNK> to fall into it !    530.3057
The one <UNK> must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago .    295.0392
cried Elizabeth .    3.2831
" <UNK> with !    19886.2578
said she .    15.0780
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have <UNK> from the hint ; but she had merely intended to <UNK> Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make    146.8980
her betray a <UNK> which might injure her in Darcy's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .    212.9418
" Oh , yes ! - - that , that is the worst of all .    29.1199
But before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .    40.9361
Mrs . Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . - - <UNK>    85.6925
staying longer , however , Elizabeth was <UNK> resolved - - nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as <UNK> themselves <UNK> long , she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley's carriage immediately , and    204.2252
at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .    136.0998
Five daughters <UNK> entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs . Bennet , for many years after Lydia's birth , had been certain that he would .    90.3722
" And this is always the way with him , " she added . - - " Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment .    37.8076
" I think you said she was a widow , sir ?    134.8940
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well - - and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a <UNK> young <UNK> , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall    143.3650
not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals . "    242.5682
" Take care , Lizzy ; that speech <UNK> strongly of disappointment . "    692.0479
He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <UNK> .    122.7176
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were <UNK> the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin .    176.0200
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security .    241.0331
All was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation .    108.2033
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast .    257.9482
" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , " said Mrs . Bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . "    39.4231
Mrs . Bennet <UNK> up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good <UNK> .    92.5702
" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ?    73.7569
<UNK> and nonsense , whims and <UNK> do <UNK> me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . - - But these , I suppose , are <UNK> what you are without . "    192.6340
Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . "    17.3369
" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle .    80.1124
" With my mother up stairs .    260.8601
Lydia was <UNK> by her two eldest sisters to hold her <UNK> ; but Mr . Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious <UNK> , though written    180.7534
solely for their benefit .    252.0364
" Some time or other he will be - - but it shall not be by me .    54.2141
Is this to be endured !    139.0749
" <UNK> !    2520.4854
To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add .    227.4033
She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns .    36.6012
Do not distress me by the idea .    128.3610
I never was .    212.2501
She is not such a simpleton .    36.5227
But no letter appeared , and she was completely <UNK> .    289.8441
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .    55.1244
Lady Catherine was <UNK> proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her .    84.9872
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends <UNK> <UNK> by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions .    192.4054
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , <UNK> decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , <UNK> and openly . "    142.4735
I know how much you dislike him . "    29.9955
my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball .    30.3451
Mrs . Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and    67.5366
manner plainly shewed how really happy he was .    686.9856
I shall see her in January .    170.0966
But slyness seems the fashion .    4843.7339
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a <UNK> coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .    98.8265
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere .    251.8962
About the <UNK> , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . "    493.0576
Her answer was warmly in his favour .    139.3781
But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .    86.2437
<UNK> were insufficient for the <UNK> of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short <UNK> .    117.9118
But I must tell you how it went off .    36.6926
" How <UNK> we are <UNK> in ! "    1220.0226
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all - - and now despise me if you dare . "    64.2444
I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not .    57.5842
The pain of separation , however , might be <UNK> on his side , by <UNK> for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him    76.3214
the happiest of men .    48.2854
They were , therefore , to go . - - Elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .    34.5539
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours    146.4785
, endeavouring to make them out .    43.3916
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? - - Do not you know that Mr . Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? "    30.9223
Good girl !    110.7548
Robinson . "    5.0837
She asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept ,    106.4102
and what had been her mother's <UNK> name ? - - Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . - - Lady Catherine then observed , " Your father's estate is entailed on Mr . Collins , I think .    91.2234
She must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine <UNK> or satin <UNK> .    604.2404
" Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife ? "    126.7480
said she , " I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply .    48.7179
" Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it .    228.0302
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .    104.2831
She related the subject of the <UNK> , the <UNK> of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain .    78.6272
She longed to see Mrs . Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " Mrs . Wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast    106.4863
of being married , to Mrs . Hill and the two <UNK> .    116.4241
Mrs . Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in <UNK> beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth , " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . "    109.8471
And is it really true ?    103.8626
" Good Heaven !    205.5590
" If you believed it impossible to be true , " said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .    45.5751
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all    89.5697
.    N/A
" This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said Elizabeth .    55.2200
<UNK> are too much like <UNK> .    440.1937
" The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . "    52.5246
Jane , " cried Elizabeth , " was there a servant <UNK> to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? "    47.0026
" And what is fifty miles of good road ?    161.5221
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two    101.0315
eldest .    45.0992
Do you often dance at St .    84.6415
" Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield .    123.1627
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr .    14.2194
Mrs . Gardiner <UNK> her stupidity .    277.7660
She found that she was to receive no other answer - - and , after a short pause , added , " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? "    34.5730
This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day . "    113.6653
She really looked almost wild . "    152.4304
As her <UNK> in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence .    786.2865
or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? "    1131.4570
I did not expect such a compliment . "    23.1573
" But why all this secrecy ?    197.3422
Mr . Bennet treated the matter differently .    121.1508
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .    111.8280
as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the <UNK> , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I    94.2385
do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the <UNK> cold <UNK> in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too .    192.5411
" That it ought not to be attempted .    66.7366
" But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ?    24.5266
Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty !    181.9727
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes .    63.0918
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess .    87.9487
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room .    48.2050
Darcy mentioned his letter .    145.3966
Not all that Mrs . Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr . Bingley .    66.8189
my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? "    67.1435
" I have already told her so once , by your desire . "    61.9270
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King .    108.6583
It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was .    72.4628
Having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the <UNK> of former partiality entirely so .    452.2920
She did indeed .    127.1320
" I wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . "    30.9320
After a short pause , her companion added , " You are too generous to trifle with me .    36.9498
But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour .    219.9941
The evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth .    84.7835
All connection between us seemed now <UNK> .    2071.2463
What do I not owe you !    158.9389
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after .    53.5421
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions .    60.5080
" I do not think we were speaking at all .    24.2503
" And is this all ? "    45.7514
she cried .    70.5225
She was humbled , she was grieved ; she <UNK> , though she hardly knew of what .    116.2171
<UNK> for you !    98.7548
I think she will be pleased with the <UNK> . "    59.0829
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility ,    90.3732
therefore , was most <UNK> in <UNK> Mr . Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr . Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go .    121.2704
He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the <UNK> attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were <UNK> for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a <UNK> relief to them all , and especially    90.2798
to her friend .    39.9476
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and <UNK> believing there was no chance of it .    214.2742
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <UNK> letter .    137.2778
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity .    104.6573
She would be in <UNK> way , you know , in that part of the house . "    54.7644
" Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . "    70.7666
The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour's t te - - t te with Mrs . Bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage - house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes ,    91.6344
that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn , produced from her , <UNK> very <UNK> smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . - - " As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to    238.0678
say - - she could not <UNK> answer - - but she did not know of any prepossession ; - - her eldest daughter , she must just mention - - she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . "    85.4692
You supposed more than really existed .    462.2353
" Upon my word ! - - Well , that was very decided indeed - - that does seem as if - - - - but however , it may all come to nothing you know . "    61.0061
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .    104.4061
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly meet Mr .    373.3137
" Your plan is a good one , " replied Elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it .    62.1670
" Perhaps I do .    32.5814
The officers of the - - - - shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman - like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but Mr . Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air ,    62.3961
and walk , as they were superior to the <UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> uncle Philips , <UNK> <UNK> wine , who followed them into the room .    577.4256
Elizabeth could not refuse , though she <UNK> little pleasure in the visit .    133.4037
The colour now <UNK> into Elizabeth's cheeks in the <UNK> conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was <UNK> whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather    166.5374
addressed to herself ; when her father continued , " You look conscious .    144.6606
The promised letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a <UNK> abode in the family might have <UNK> .    163.1042
Mrs . Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . "    60.4985
Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home .    148.9359
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs . Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light .    166.2509
That Mr . Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but without <UNK> any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal <UNK> in town , as Mr . Bennet thought it possible they might have gone    99.5404
to one of them , on their first coming to London , before they procured lodgings .    72.8538
How long has she been such a favourite ? - - and pray when am I to wish you joy ? "    105.2445
" But you forget , mama , " said Elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs . Long has promised to introduce him . "    28.8388
" She looks sickly and cross . - - Yes , she will do for him very well .    69.7449
I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong .    90.1299
First of all , he asked Miss Lucas .    86.6726
Mr . Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding , and made no answer .    64.0350
But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well .    101.0381
If he did <UNK> his <UNK> , it was not till Sir William was out of sight .    162.7084
The general prejudice against Mr . Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light .    114.0861
When this was done , she had a less active part to play .    96.7582
" Not so hasty , if you please .    49.2026
my dear brother , " replied Mrs . Bennet , " that is exactly what I could most wish for .    24.1737
" Oh , well !    21.1462
You know my sentiments . "    47.7132
" <UNK> so - - I thank you . "    74.4283
I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient .    73.6283
" And I have another favour to ask .    90.1295
Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill - judged thing in the world !    73.6959
I cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . "    243.9064
Of his former way of life , nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself .    84.4329
<UNK> , however , that this studied <UNK> spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and    144.9412
the day after the next was fixed on .    80.5060
As all conversation was <UNK> at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room .    144.3311
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply .    259.7557
However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr . Darcy might have done as well . "    43.6569
While Sir William was with them , Mr . Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <UNK> , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that    90.5973
they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book    118.9121
room , which <UNK> the road .    425.7672
But if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been <UNK> , nothing can be said in her    359.4136
defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , and that its ill - success might perhaps <UNK> her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment .    203.6971
I came to you without a doubt of my reception .    44.1331
I need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so <UNK> dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may    126.4587
feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable .    98.3360
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . "    60.1303
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention .    54.8489
Had his character been known , this could not have happened .    60.5464
" <UNK> a doubt , they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , " replied Jane ; " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .    83.6727
" Yes - - the late Mr . Darcy <UNK> me the next presentation of the best living in his <UNK> .    122.6368
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head .    43.8219
He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her .    224.0903
" Oh ! "    3.7911
" I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . "    159.2627
Bingley . - - It was an <UNK> subject , and Mrs . Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .    87.8731
I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr . Darcy's regard . "    38.4663
There was no <UNK> upon such a <UNK> .    582.4519
Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and <UNK> heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him .    62.3657
The rooms were <UNK> and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither <UNK> nor <UNK> fine ; with less of <UNK> , and more real elegance , than the    225.0182
furniture of Rosings .    120.5266
" I will make no promise of the kind . "    25.4417
Without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire , and represent to    63.0296
her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment .    325.1472
" I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this - - though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him - - I had supposed him to be <UNK> his fellow - creatures in general , but did not    62.7530
suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such <UNK> as this ! "    456.5330
Mr . Darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together .    23.4528
Oh , no . "    28.8123
You see how continually we are engaged there .    214.9691
I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music .    49.4307
Her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted .    47.1886
It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration .    56.6902
" You have a house in town , I conclude ? "    28.4173
" It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he <UNK> the use of his reason .    87.3487
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault - - because I would not take the trouble of <UNK> .    61.4745
" I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth .    133.8008
No ; <UNK> had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .    175.7694
What am I to do ? "    60.8317
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? "    32.1168
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . "    73.0696
" I am afraid you do not like your pen .    46.1282
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs . Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .    169.7994
But her commendation , though <UNK> her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr . Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands .    115.0628
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .    79.2677
" It ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many <UNK> . "    36.0977
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly <UNK> to it , and that there are very few of us who do not <UNK> a feeling of self - complacency on the score of    89.4779
some <UNK> or other , real or imaginary .    920.4314
What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . "    39.3714
" But not before they went to Brighton ? "    44.3313
" And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley .    61.8562
How could I be so silly as to wish it !    37.2715
I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present <UNK> , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr . Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of <UNK> <UNK> , for which I have pledged myself .    153.5947
repeated Darcy <UNK> ; " yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . "    388.9593
" Yes , indeed , " cried Mrs . Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .    38.7964
She had even learnt to <UNK> , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an <UNK> and a <UNK> to disgust and weary .    364.5263
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .    129.6142
" <UNK> at all .    346.6393
" Upon my word , " said Mrs . Gardiner , " I begin to be of your uncle's opinion .    24.8898
Bingley urged Mr . Jones's being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most <UNK> <UNK> .    333.1447
My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr . Darcy , to be <UNK> his father's favourite in such a manner , - - one , whom his father had promised to provide for . - - It is impossible .    100.8427
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .    217.0258
<UNK> it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done    113.8809
any thing to deserve to lose it .    51.5686
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs . Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which <UNK> it all .    224.3533
Adieu .    18.7121
This son was to join in <UNK> off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for .    229.8758
He really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger .    113.5058
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .    130.3845
yes . - - Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley .    80.7336
She knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour .    208.1847
The coach , therefore , took them the first <UNK> of their journey , and brought its master back to Longbourn .    124.1834
<UNK> haste , make haste .    325.1825
The visit was returned in due form .    381.1404
His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most <UNK> and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion .    180.4742
This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley .    130.9953
There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , I dare say . "    66.5114
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to <UNK> people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?    78.4233
Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .    204.3509
" You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? "    145.7534
And gravely glancing at Mr . Darcy , " There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with - - ' <UNK> your <UNK> to cool your <UNK> , ' - - and I shall keep mine to <UNK> my song .    243.4648
"    N/A
They descended the <UNK> , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned .    169.5202
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and <UNK> liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted    108.4426
at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day .    55.2072
" These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth .    102.1487
" He is as fine a fellow , " said Mr . Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever I saw .    22.9811
I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is .    30.1712
And rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr . Collins thus addressed her , " When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you    98.3299
have now given me ; though I am far from <UNK> you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage    112.3193
my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . "    147.2525
She answered him with cold civility .    227.5075
I must beg to return to the house . "    41.8084
Such a disappointment !    178.9034
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .    30.6775
I did not wink at you . "    90.6854
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible !    86.2107
But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Mr . Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely <UNK> throughout the    226.5122
whole .    27.5662
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a <UNK> from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her <UNK> before the servants , while they waited    97.9514
at table , and judged it better that one only of the <UNK> , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject .    140.1097
when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again !    29.1672
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .    118.0670
But she is too much like her brother , - - very , very proud . - - As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .    91.3770
These were the contents : " MY DEAR <UNK> , " You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as I am <UNK> .    124.4645
said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam .    262.6375
" <UNK> with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means .    205.9860
" My dearest child , " she cried , " I can think of nothing else !    26.5182
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour    110.5921
was a constant source of delight .    101.6004
" Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . "    27.6064
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .    619.6388
This room was my late master's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then .    198.5107
She will be down in a moment I dare say . "    39.0175
" Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by <UNK> . "    168.6453
It was over at last however .    76.1995
said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . "    62.6035
To such perseverance in wilful self - deception Elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he <UNK> in considering her repeated <UNK> as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a    433.9507
manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the <UNK> and <UNK> of an elegant female .    282.5565
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley .    396.6707
" This is quite shocking ! - - He deserves to be publicly <UNK> . "    140.5255
It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully <UNK> as your's seems to have been .    330.7542
I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ?    189.1320
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure ; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by <UNK> not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her ,    111.0062
without any danger of seeing him .    27.6984
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money .    98.5402
They all exclaimed against such <UNK> ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr . Bennet in every endeavour    94.9850
for recovering Lydia .    796.7216
" And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? "    47.7020
Only look at her .    43.9323
" MY DEAR <UNK> , " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction .    91.1490
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr . Darcy they had only seen at church .    74.2942
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every <UNK> impatience .    600.5307
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have <UNK> them , without actual blame on either side . "    155.2536
This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once .    114.1981
But is it certain , absolutely certain ? "    138.9079
But Mrs . Bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which would exactly finish Jane's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .    108.2921
" You are then resolved to have him ? "    57.5589
It is often only <UNK> of opinion , and sometimes an <UNK> boast . "    566.7396
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley , and was obliged to assume a <UNK> for seeing it .    68.4072
There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs . <UNK> , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what .    110.0003
said Lydia <UNK> , " I am not afraid ; for though I am the youngest , <UNK> the <UNK> . "    171.6719
But if you are really <UNK> and ignorant , I must be more <UNK> .    219.3263
said she .    15.0780
No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; - - the very <UNK> - <UNK> for Netherfield were got by <UNK> .    549.2780
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject .    80.8944
Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was <UNK> to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might    149.4797
not spend the <UNK> of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next <UNK> to purchase .    231.1409
I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require . "    70.4208
The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual ,    82.7476
to the <UNK> of Kitty .    226.5664
He is perfectly amiable .    54.5565
From the drawing - room they could <UNK> nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform    133.1673
them of , though it happened almost every day .    260.0388
Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable    101.3178
as they were represented by common report .    224.3081
She could not bear such suspense ; and hastily <UNK> a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt , if it were <UNK> with the secrecy which had been intended .    149.7579
" Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to <UNK> her ? "    156.0244
You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have <UNK> me ; - - though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . "    83.2359
" I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . Bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly .    17.8539
<UNK> to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress .    78.1173
<UNK> letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance .    172.7681
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr . Darcy's proposals .    96.3944
" Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget .    54.5354
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time .    105.8361
" <UNK> out , " said Mrs . Bennet , " that is very unlucky . "    15.1144
Her aunt asked her , <UNK> , how she liked it .    155.5013
But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done .    69.3482
" I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . "    44.6407
This was invitation enough .    298.5571
" That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me before .    17.7882
Those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown ,    98.1018
or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs . Forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; - - and from her correspondence with her sister ,    65.3846
there was still less to be learnt - - for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .    135.2951
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope my <UNK> are good enough for her .    131.4850
In spite of her deeply - <UNK> dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till ,    104.4239
roused to resentment by his <UNK> language , she lost all compassion in anger .    596.2277
" My aunt , " she continued , " is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor - street . "    31.7579
Does your charge give you much trouble ?    314.7168
Mrs . Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr . Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to    45.4355
join in their censure of her , in spite of all Miss Bingley's <UNK> on fine eyes .    199.6696
<UNK> as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland .    90.7405
" Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs . Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . "    45.0641
" Gracechurch - street , <UNK> . <NUMBER> .    311.0685
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , <UNK> off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the <UNK> of <UNK> , " You , who so well know my    176.8148
feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .    95.1907
Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family <UNK> to be disposed of , she could    88.6931
not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .    164.9511
They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain .    54.0981
Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins's correspondence for any consideration .    154.0527
My faults , according to this <UNK> , are heavy indeed !    800.9100
He replied , and was again silent .    104.4668
At length , quite <UNK> by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great <UNK> and said , " How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this    129.2689
way !    27.7180
Mr . Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister's sufferings .    183.2453
The park <UNK> was still the <UNK> on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .    237.8484
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the <UNK>    86.5818
of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his <UNK> side .    145.4585
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued - - that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling .    125.6320
" Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest .    168.3698
" Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? - - At present I have not room to do them justice . "    77.9098
" How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "    103.1948
You may have drawn him in . "    108.0069
He readily agreed to it .    151.8476
accompanied by a violent <UNK> .    800.2191
She was not of so <UNK> a temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less <UNK> .    232.3823
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your <UNK> will ever be gratified .    81.1615
He was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " <UNK> as you please . "    84.0496
Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? "    45.4214
His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane , and to    68.8286
be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do .    53.3088
You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most <UNK> .    491.2927
I always had a value for him .    152.3707
But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house    140.0517
.    N/A
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .    130.5072
How Mr . Darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell .    18.1724
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour .    48.1728
Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley's way . "    32.9152
" Oh !    6.1638
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room .    59.9439
" I am not likely to leave Kent for some time .    41.2295
I knew how it would be .    24.4437
Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased .    98.1154
I can no longer help thanking you for your <UNK> kindness to my poor sister .    127.0386
" I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . "    46.1743
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a <UNK> .    171.6648
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me .    104.7923
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first .    80.3320
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton .    99.4678
<UNK> haste , and come down this moment . "    75.8733
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true <UNK> will derive benefit from such as are given .    328.1420
" An easy distance do you call it ?    314.6714
" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter    74.8791
.    N/A
They were not the only objects of Mr . Collins's admiration .    77.1776
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was <UNK> with admiration was evident enough .    273.3267
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active <UNK> in her own parish , the <UNK> concerns of which were carried to her by Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of    104.2105
the <UNK> were disposed to be <UNK> , discontented or too poor , she <UNK> forth into the village to settle their <UNK> , silence their complaints , and <UNK> them into <UNK> and <UNK> .    948.3566
She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you .    173.9258
Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by <UNK> the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute    172.1520
certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father's incredulity , and <UNK> him to the match .    190.2938
" I am , " said he , with a firm voice .    21.2995
She was shewn into the breakfast - parlour , where all but Jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . - - That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by    74.3405
herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it .    51.1946
or had you intended any more serious consequence ? "    290.8253
I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them .    181.1696
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful .    70.5347
Since her father's death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and <UNK> her education . "    254.8405
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs . Bennet's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " Oh !    72.9630
We were married , you know , at St . <UNK> , because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish .    210.9384
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most    78.6814
<UNK> , she even shook hands with the former . - - Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .    85.1072
I must beg , therefore , to be <UNK> no farther on the subject . "    48.1175
" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . "    66.4158
When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs . Bennet was <UNK> of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time .    85.0472
When the tea - things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a <UNK> to her mother's <UNK> for    133.5029
whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party .    55.2341
Mrs . Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity .    197.9978
" All young ladies accomplished !    346.2646
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention .    135.5570
Without a governess you must have been neglected . "    57.6949
She not <UNK> stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .    141.6492
" Yes , in <UNK> with his friend . "    72.6011
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her - - indeed I rather believe he did - - I heard something about it - - but I hardly know what - - something about Mr .    71.2814
She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little <UNK> as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as    64.0393
to meet Miss Bennet .    63.8639
Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? "    53.6172
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .    148.0282
And what do you think she said besides ?    126.6945
They have some of the finest woods in the country . "    41.7213
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . "    21.4112
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no <UNK> for it .    116.0089
Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable .    102.8605
He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself .    71.3802
Mr . Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .    70.5904
A young man , such as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident <UNK> them , so easily <UNK> her , that these sort of <UNK> are very frequent . "    136.1479
" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from    35.3227
objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , - - a preference    70.5348
which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . "    97.8228
They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . "    64.6332
" Oh !    6.1638
My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to <UNK> them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by    131.1161
asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last .    68.2392
" If we thought <UNK> of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .    82.0046
You wanted me , I know , to say ' Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of <UNK> my taste ; but I always delight in <UNK> those kind of schemes , and <UNK> a person of their <UNK> contempt .    214.0644
Her enquiries after her sister were not very <UNK> answered .    397.7098
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? "    130.4155
The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .    510.2107
He takes them now for people of fashion . "    240.3132
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion .    197.8445
He danced only four dances !    243.0499
They could not be <UNK> by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his <UNK> report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have <UNK> it for    118.3102
Mr . Darcy .    8.1195
They have a sharp , <UNK> look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - <UNK> without fashion , which is intolerable . "    140.0836
It was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her's .    77.0370
In a short time , I shall have a daughter married .    33.0443
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all .    65.0049
He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister .    111.4956
" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? "    64.7805
Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant <UNK> to the house .    130.5378
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .    214.0305
When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing .    34.0373
However , he wrote some <UNK> on her , and very pretty they were . "    108.9495
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing - room , to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself .    80.0763
She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one's approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was <UNK> by Wickham .    135.0327
How can Mr . Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ?    103.6913
Darcy . "    6.3686
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .    43.8901
" As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs . Bennet , " you will wait on him of course . "    23.4343
" Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by <UNK> their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it    65.4538
<UNK> .    30.1277
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy .    118.5175
I only fear that the sort of <UNK> , to which you , I imagine , have been <UNK> , is merely <UNK> on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe .    316.9987
- - A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs . Hurst began again .    102.8192
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her - - that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself    75.7414
to be right .    96.1277
* * * * * It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the    165.4449
whole of the journey .    62.1461
She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley .    50.3567
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . "    25.1266
The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : "    132.2277
My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish .    356.0994
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted .    85.8566
He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she    69.5877
could reply , he added , " It is above eight months .    65.9809
" Not yet , " replied Jane .    31.7906
cried Elizabeth , <UNK> up for a moment .    134.5755
" Yes , Ma'am , all . "    16.5239
Not that I care about it , though .    96.3091
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . Bennet perhaps <UNK> the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .    99.5808
Their powers of conversation were considerable .    276.3778
<UNK> my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey .    72.1128
My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . "    87.0860
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs . Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .    116.9204
His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go .    55.4431
said Jane .    11.6758
James's ? "    17.0561
" I like her appearance , " said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas .    75.2833
Does she live near you , sir ? "    152.9647
" I never heard that it was . "    10.5547
They <UNK> him in various ways ; with <UNK> questions , ingenious <UNK> , and distant <UNK> ; but he <UNK> the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas .    443.4707
" I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future .    77.7766
And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ?    100.2736
cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! - - and yet how many things have happened ! "    79.6505
You need not .    93.7661
" I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment    54.8773
in occasionally <UNK> opinions which in fact are not your own . "    837.8865
I understand that Mr . Collins has made you an offer of marriage .    30.8093
<UNK> them next to your great uncle the judge .    851.1588
We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary .    97.0557
Have all her friends left her ? "    57.0239
Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a <UNK> of <UNK> , to make merry at her wedding . "    105.9582
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever .    66.1769
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more .    78.4757
But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table    106.9562
, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .    73.8874
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard .    54.2303
It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world .    55.8026
This is my advice .    57.1225
Their sister's wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself .    88.2467
DEAR SIR , The <UNK> subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to <UNK> the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by    241.0766
my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem <UNK> to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at <UNK> . - - " There , Mrs .    124.3104
" But I was embarrassed . "    44.1492
Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .    85.4222
" There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . "    60.2803
" If it is <UNK> done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . "    119.6621
<UNK> daughters married !    817.1015
Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his <UNK> on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away .    99.6981
I should say , one of her ladyship's carriages , for she has several . "    107.1230
My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .    51.5141
" Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .    122.4761
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than    88.9073
as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner . "    84.3698
That is all to be forgot .    29.6343
That he should even speak to her was amazing ! - - but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family !    81.5684
This cannot be !    141.3335
She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it .    79.9288
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was .    527.2802
This is your <UNK> resolve !    3938.1458
how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would <UNK> you about to all the balls .    90.0291
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough .    119.2842
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a <UNK> from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a <UNK> voice , " Are you pleased with Kent ? "    141.6254
" She will drop the acquaintance entirely . "    209.8323
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied .    83.6563
She <UNK> bitterly of all this to her husband .    466.0975
" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said Lady Catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not <UNK> a great deal . "    42.1823
" Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of humility .    49.9140
<UNK> the most violent against him was Mrs . Bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was <UNK> into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters .    153.3798
While she spoke , an <UNK> glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .    188.3457
Good bye .    134.4846
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? "    135.5681
" But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so <UNK> , so <UNK> , so <UNK> , that it gives me very little idea .    440.7453
But Mr . Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr . Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning .    59.7011
" I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself .    66.1862
It was agreed to .    64.8010
" Oh , yes ! - - of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt .    36.0547
I know your disposition , Lizzy .    50.6320
" But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be brought to reason .    25.1805
That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice !    112.0071
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .    54.1324
They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too .    72.7285
When the ladies were <UNK> for the <UNK> , he said to Elizabeth , " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your <UNK> .    90.8898
Is there one among the sex , who would not <UNK> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?    184.0002
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs . Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs . Collins , was a very genteel    63.2774
, pretty kind of girl .    240.1869
About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who <UNK> over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for    207.4662
there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . <UNK> , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her <UNK> and <UNK> , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness    304.9082
to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .    57.2870
There can be no love in all this .    45.5366
<UNK> must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .    195.9575
The whole family in short were properly <UNK> on the occasion .    366.5438
My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be .    113.5522
Mrs . Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary <UNK> of <UNK> , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four months    215.1632
.    N/A
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful .    457.5595
And is such a girl to be my <UNK> sister ?    132.2373
Mr . Bingley <UNK> property to the <UNK> of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . - - Mr .    91.6925
I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . - - That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; - - but his regard did not appear to me enough    82.0119
<UNK> for him to see her without some danger . - - Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . - - It is done , however , and it was done for the best . - - On this subject I have nothing more to    59.2747
say , no other apology to offer .    100.7287
At night she opened her heart to Jane .    138.4743
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .    68.1717
In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . "    75.9907
" Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished .    187.4852
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement .    78.2887
He was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect    133.0814
your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' She a beauty ! - - I should as soon call her mother a wit . '    255.4509
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh - - the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time .    69.8523
Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .    253.3851
I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better .    35.6075
It will not do .    24.8307
They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually    113.0888
repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .    468.6848
" My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . "    32.4114
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant <UNK> every virtue . "    83.8887
He readily assured her of his secrecy - - again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went    183.3410
away .    6.1458
And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married .    120.5569
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world .    117.5955
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country .    36.4475
" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness .    72.8211
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . "    74.1460
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes .    424.7899
Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done <UNK> .    235.3197
Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something <UNK> of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence .    356.1776
After <UNK> their sisters , they <UNK> displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn <UNK> usually <UNK> , exclaiming , " Is not this nice ?    1591.8029
" There is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not <UNK> .    51.8007
" Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . "    48.7055
What a good joke it will be !    136.2578
Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? "    106.5505
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .    145.5214
This , madam , is a faithful <UNK> of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me <UNK> of cruelty towards Mr . Wickham .    164.4631
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle .    202.8745
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place .    201.2699
And that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . "    123.4079
It is too long ago .    65.5682
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia .    90.1466
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr . Darcy - - that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had <UNK> the Netherfield ball the very next week .    95.7798
You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . "    36.5949
" Undoubtedly .    119.0769
But whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the first raptures    98.8117
of her joy , than the first <UNK> of her disapprobation .    99.0521
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection .    84.3102
They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .    162.5590
But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " No , no ; stay where you are . - - You are charmingly <UNK> , and appear to uncommon advantage .    127.9445
" So much the better .    87.7142
It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . "    375.3648
After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .    129.0856
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .    350.2449
She saw all the <UNK> of the camp ; its <UNK> <UNK> forth in <UNK> <UNK> of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and <UNK> with <UNK> ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a <UNK> , <UNK> flirting with    1137.4984
at least six officers at once .    220.4272
She then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham .    106.0428
While in their <UNK> , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and    96.3095
wholly <UNK> to the family !    278.4082
I speak <UNK> .    9163.5566
What could be more natural than his asking you again ?    82.9132
As the day of his arrival drew near , " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister .    46.2993
cried Elizabeth , " I am excessively diverted .    22.9409
He <UNK> the business just as he pleases . "    324.9547
It is evident that you belong to the first <UNK> .    171.7757
I hope he will overlook it .    60.3512
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to <UNK> her mother's schemes .    105.4334
Mrs . Bennet's schemes for this day were <UNK> .    260.0985
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ! - - Your sister has been talking to me about    116.4848
him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr . Darcy's steward .    87.2068
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr . Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it .    46.7475
We had better not mention it .    65.6213
This will never do . "    24.2682
Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . - - Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment .    790.9841
And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . "    37.2391
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material    281.5323
weight in confirming or <UNK> it .    2891.7451
She has been allowed to <UNK> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .    153.3469
" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . Bennet , " and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman .    17.8692
The Lucases are very <UNK> people indeed , sister .    872.7960
" Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude <UNK> him , and that in spite of her being his patroness ,    81.5204
she is an <UNK> , conceited woman . "    157.5514
Jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a <UNK> way .    61.6027
- - " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point .    34.7221
But it must not , shall not be .    83.3625
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and <UNK> to the honour of <UNK> by an address to the King , during his <UNK> .    150.5086
Had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together - - and four evenings may do a great deal . "    107.6419
" I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . "    69.4213
To <UNK> assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit .    377.1246
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object .    48.9307
" This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree .    49.2100
It will save me a world of trouble and economy .    554.4581
and turning round , he looked for a moment at Elizabeth , till <UNK> her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence    115.1459
to young ladies who are slighted by other men .    263.1178
If , indeed , it should be so !    34.0657
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . "    57.7027
She accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been lost .    95.9252
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her .    129.5631
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were <UNK> ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs . Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in    97.8620
listening to what she said , and placing a <UNK> in the proper direction before her eyes .    105.0211
But however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so .    195.4054
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from <UNK> his real character .    153.2841
" Can you deny that you have done it ? "    36.5801
Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .    44.7839
The stupidity with which he was <UNK> by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon    334.6349
that establishment were gained .    959.2707
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of <UNK> this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to <UNK> her .    294.7510
The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly .    173.3687
The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more .    118.1976
Your ladyship wants Mr . Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ?    234.0587
Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .    77.9066
" And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? "    71.5599
Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs . Bennet by admiring Mrs . Philips's manners and politeness .    114.3716
" What will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are !    53.8291
" She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley .    35.4817
" I know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder .    57.6882
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ?    123.4167
I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming .    44.0009
A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any <UNK> beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration    680.0172
will excite .    1320.5479
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . "    57.4953
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . "    85.0938
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable .    178.2160
" She is a most charming young lady indeed .    41.7554
" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? "    36.5144
We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . "    78.4967
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re - appear at Longbourn .    134.7633
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . - - I cannot blame myself for having done thus much .    109.7226
What are we to do ! "    66.4048
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a <UNK> , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to <UNK> at his table , nor was Mrs . Hurst , who had married a man    76.5054
of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .    269.8335
" This is a wretched beginning indeed !    123.3145
In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually <UNK> her authority , but stating it to be such as might be <UNK> on .    152.8203
" La !    46.0548
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband . - - It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly <UNK> . - - She hated having visitors    114.4704
in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .    107.3851
" And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ?    88.1619
It <UNK> all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity .    3474.1587
" We will be down as soon as we can , " said Jane ; " but I dare say Kitty is <UNK> than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . "    51.4058
Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr . <UNK> .    116.6145
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world .    139.4576
Mrs . Reynolds could interest her on no other point .    69.3802
" Oh , yes ! - - if one could but go to Brighton !    33.8633
" Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? "    111.7556
" I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied Elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it . - - I must be in town next Saturday . "    21.9705
I have a high respect for your nerves .    89.8374
That such a consequence as this should <UNK> , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . "    175.0418
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging .    156.3549
I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain .    73.0807
Mr . Bingley followed his advice .    40.7580
He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in Derbyshire .    47.5739
I thought I should have broke my heart . "    40.2274
thought Elizabeth .    36.1196
Jane shook her head .    23.8315
His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an <UNK> as she believed she was considered by the others .    90.5785
yes - - the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! - - She <UNK> and <UNK> all day long .    189.6443
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise - - all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible    117.4289
.    N/A
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them .    122.6829
She saw him <UNK> at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . "    52.2857
" A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected .    157.1861
" I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this .    159.9613
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . "    1023.8511
" My dear sir , " replied Mr . Collins , " I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's <UNK> . "    69.5142
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr . Wickham's attentions .    92.4000
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last <UNK> of <UNK> .    378.9718
<UNK> me whilst you can . "    249.9571
It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs . Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere    86.2898
trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy .    88.7365
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her .    107.3960
Mrs . Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete <UNK> over him , continued her triumph .    233.4045
Her ease and good spirits increased .    367.9388
" To Jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection .    44.7285
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less    210.4862
generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . - - I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened ,    129.6190
which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . - - He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .    110.6485
- - The part which I acted , is now to be explained . - - His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our <UNK> of feeling was soon discovered ; and , <UNK> sensible that no time was to be lost in <UNK>    237.8956
their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . - - We accordingly went - - and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . - - I described , and    114.5446
<UNK> them earnestly . - - But , however this <UNK> might have <UNK> or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would <UNK> have prevented the marriage , had it not been <UNK> by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your    237.6350
sister's indifference .    306.7508
A lively imagination soon settled it all .    307.7381
When is your turn to come ?    72.1329
" I am not one and twenty . "    42.2594
" I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and <UNK> a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world    44.6016
, which is always the way with her , for she has , without <UNK> , the sweetest temper I ever met with .    180.5056
Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance .    141.9916
She will make him a very proper wife . "    44.5618
Mrs . Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation .    71.0255
" But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be <UNK> . "    82.1857
One came from her books , and the other from her <UNK> .    138.0459
<UNK> the bell , Kitty , for Hill .    126.3612
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her <UNK> from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere <UNK> of money and rank , she thought she could witness without <UNK> .    368.9222
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw - - and if he becomes really attached to me - - I believe it will be better that he should not .    58.6713
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was <UNK> on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty .    168.7511
" For my own part , " she <UNK> , " I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .    50.9073
We both know that he has been <UNK> in every sense of the word .    121.4359
This part of his intelligence , though <UNK> by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less <UNK> for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so <UNK>    192.5559
by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . - - <UNK> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <UNK> to Wickham .    233.3472
It was first broken by Mrs . Annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs . Gardiner , with    99.4641
occasional help from Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .    265.4037
" She is a very fine - looking woman !    79.1872
They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to <UNK> , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite    393.2047
hills , with the long range of woods <UNK> many , and occasionally part of the stream .    334.7398
Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . "    127.7663
<UNK> or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me . "    253.5748
Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .    66.1263
" He did not talk to me of his own arts , " said Fitzwilliam smiling .    53.3597
And on the gentlemen's approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan't come and part us , I am determined .    114.0229
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never <UNK> enough to say before ) how much I like him .    70.0396
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet .    40.0208
Say that urgent business <UNK> us home immediately .    5187.4575
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation - - a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice ,    151.3403
and Darcy and Bingley were seen <UNK> down the street .    650.0444
Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected .    53.1731
I have great hopes of finding him quite the <UNK> .    305.3849
But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . "    57.2628
Perhaps there was some truth in this ; though I doubt whether his reserve , or <UNK> reserve , can be <UNK> for the event .    206.1177
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a <UNK> shop just over the way .    155.5202
Be so kind as to <UNK> for us to Miss Darcy .    198.7960
What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! "    114.3017
Her mother only <UNK> her for being nonsensical .    1036.8119
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose <UNK> and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and    175.0400
nothing was heard of his return .    45.4963
Had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his <UNK> , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment <UNK> from his horse or his carriage .    169.9040
she was dying to know what could be his meaning " - - and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?    148.3863
You take delight in <UNK> me .    1766.8019
" Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? "    179.2530
Mrs . Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner .    73.5707
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?    350.6399
Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . "    208.9788
For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .    69.7806
Elizabeth replied that it was .    72.2515
I was only <UNK> for the moment , because I felt that I should be looked at .    87.7548
Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . "    99.4750
Elizabeth coloured , and said - - " A little . "    31.6832
I know not what to think .    38.8925
certainly , " cried his faithful <UNK> , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly <UNK> what is usually met with .    290.3539
It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .    130.3353
cried Mrs . Gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive .    70.5587
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's .    100.5531
" I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself - - for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . "    101.4039
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr . Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him .    58.5702
But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger <UNK> even than pride . "    118.3489
Mr .    1.0254
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's .    153.0351
" No , I should have turned in a moment . "    24.5850
Let Wickham be your man .    517.9076
" The <UNK> boast ; - - for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and <UNK> of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .    251.4796
Wickham . - - <UNK> and <UNK> to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion ,    139.3855
would be a <UNK> , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the <UNK> of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . - - But from the <UNK> of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting    183.3321
each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . - - If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings    95.0015
which may be offensive to your's , I can only say that I am sorry . - - The necessity must be obeyed - - and farther apology would be absurd . - - I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with    73.7770
others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country . - - But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . - - I had often    60.8415
seen him in love before . - - At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas's accidental information , that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of    107.4292
their marriage .    86.7776
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .    83.3357
But who was your mother ?    106.8738
I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . "    24.4212
Four nieces of Mrs . Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .    120.4893
When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .    74.1465
" No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you .    24.6390
But , really , I know not what to say .    55.3567
" Is it possible ! "    69.5842
" My dear Madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall <UNK> myself of it as soon as possible . "    45.2567
But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication .    54.7960
They walked on , without knowing in what direction .    134.5668
As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several <UNK> in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a <UNK> glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so    148.3005
full of <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have <UNK> its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .    415.3892
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " In vain have I struggled .    121.8535
But will they make you happy ? "    66.8818
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but Elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window - - she looked , - - she saw Mr . Darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister .    45.4062
Her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , " Why is he so altered ?    160.4413
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr . Collins .    45.9740
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had <UNK> as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs . Collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered .    77.1694
She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . "    47.8054
Mr . Bennet replied that he had not .    21.3837
" If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the subject .    29.4526
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival .    155.8451
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance , <UNK> with them many instructions on execution and taste .    384.0940
" I did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon - making was not so <UNK> to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been <UNK>    155.9091
accordingly . "    13.2851
" But how did he account for it ? "    61.1966
" I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception .    17.8018
It is such a <UNK> to one's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind .    302.4220
" That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . "    66.1343
" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these .    153.5590
cried Mrs . Bennet , <UNK> her head , " then she is better off than many girls .    109.6965
Mr . Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once .    60.8106
Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an <UNK> smile , and said , " You mean to <UNK> me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?    72.9892
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had <UNK> to his amusement .    260.4772
" I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .    29.6066
" If it were merely a fine house <UNK> <UNK> , " said she , " I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful .    125.8590
He never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third <UNK> that he was asking some odd unconnected questions - - about her pleasure in being at Hunsford    211.0403
, her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . and Mrs . Collins's happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there    109.5907
too .    131.8282
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from <UNK> to the library ; - - their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <UNK> , who said    86.9005
, " If you are looking for my master , <UNK> , he is walking towards the little copse . "    100.4005
Elizabeth immediately began playing again .    271.0022
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its <UNK> was owing .    207.2674
But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . "    58.8214
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . "    25.9265
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .    460.3842
" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? "    202.9485
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .    67.4847
Good Heaven !    59.0222
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .    113.2629
" Only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time .    93.0388
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been <UNK> from alarm and vexation .    185.1932
" Is he married or single ? "    207.0170
<UNK> as she had been by the <UNK> walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the <UNK> of an intercourse renewed after many years <UNK> .    165.8713
" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr .    188.2187
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time .    213.4845
Can I speak <UNK> ?    3887.1458
In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it .    54.6729
Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . "    58.3817
" I hope , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party    34.0207
. "    1.1836
" Can it be possible that he will marry her ? "    54.7794
He scarcely <UNK> an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs . Bennet's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .    118.4033
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning .    70.7159
His diffidence had prevented his <UNK> on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy .    214.3822
As to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring .    58.9521
" But perhaps he may be a little <UNK> in his civilities , " replied her uncle .    61.0311
" And quite alone ?    286.4110
<UNK> calmness of temper and presence of mind !    517.9343
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . "    63.6108
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer .    111.8627
Mr . <UNK> his name .    333.7489
Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . - - <UNK> of the party were now applied to .    106.3424
On the stairs were a <UNK> of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower .    108.5180
They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough <UNK> and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread - bare <UNK> to listen to .    530.9960
And so , you like this man's sisters too , do you ?    242.3533
She went on .    137.9263
Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge .    122.3387
for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . "    74.6729
They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are .    47.8256
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? "    57.9092
The dear <UNK> rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year .    579.3455
Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .    115.9902
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . "    129.6153
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .    252.4016
" Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? "    189.8863
" And you saw him frequently ? "    31.8845
" And what am I to do on the occasion ? - - It seems an hopeless business . "    98.6278
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some <UNK> , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy .    164.5486
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . Collins too ! - - Why should he have it more than anybody else ? "    127.2287
There are few people whom I really love , and still <UNK> of whom I think well .    246.7883
As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be    50.1235
settled too near her family .    68.1547
After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re - considering events , determining <UNK> , and <UNK> herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of    288.2553
her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of <UNK> such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation .    126.2759
My youngest sister has left all her friends - - has <UNK> ; - - has thrown herself into the power of - - of Mr . Wickham .    116.3144
Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter .    143.5759
" What should not you mind ? "    30.1440
" In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . "    27.4906
" But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . "    33.1638
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was <UNK> by this conversation .    208.7934
<UNK> him - - laugh at him . - - <UNK> as you are , you must know how it is to be done . "    40.9781
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly <UNK> even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .    107.9292
Such a charming man ! - - so handsome !    37.7008
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object .    47.0532
The <UNK> , <UNK> with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .    740.9485
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr . Darcy !    45.3195
To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it    110.8241
for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .    71.7472
His character is <UNK> complete . "    509.6414
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted !    498.2474
At length however Mrs . Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who had been long <UNK> at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold <UNK> and <UNK> .    140.9452
He made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton .    51.4527
Mrs . Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs . Bennet and Mrs . Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces .    62.8158
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ?    405.2266
" This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full <UNK> . "    184.5924
My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not .    54.6224
The children have been wanting me this half hour .    236.5288
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . - - Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life .    90.5702
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object .    71.4414
His marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill - natured tone that she " wished they might be happy . "    88.3100
After <UNK> it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family    99.1276
dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .    102.7157
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged .    135.9877
She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times .    118.1586
It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . "    190.4346
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was <UNK> .    104.0126
Of this she was perfectly <UNK> ; - - to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with .    95.0462
is she handsome ? "    55.0125
Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself .    100.9613
He has also <UNK> pride , which with some <UNK> affection , makes him a very kind and careful <UNK> of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . "    326.0268
This Mrs . <UNK> was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town .    74.8987
" Let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early enough for expectation . "    47.9593
Dear me !    61.5513
<UNK> and pride are different things , though the words are often used <UNK> .    330.9294
" Well , and so we <UNK> at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them .    128.5482
After many pauses and many <UNK> of other subjects , Elizabeth could not help <UNK> once more to the first , and saying , " I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr . Bingley !    129.0381
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr . Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the    65.9021
two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters .    172.5996
If this be the case , he deserves you .    80.0702
" Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr . Bingley to her . "    18.3495
But it was a hope shortly checked by other <UNK> , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural    145.9961
as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham .    1347.1566
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met .    131.7136
He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .    347.0081
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends .    85.4285
Had it been your uncle's doing , I must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way .    325.2543
Mrs . Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch - street , and repeated <UNK> <UNK> at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance .    165.7162
Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned back .    59.6904
The <UNK> in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the <UNK> feelings of early and    272.4520
unexpected prosperity .    528.4325
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the <UNK> of the early trees .    75.6389
I certainly have had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now .    50.2755
Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long <UNK> , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and <UNK> <UNK> , at the request    201.4722
of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room .    95.2558
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being <UNK> dressed .    195.0829
" Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley .    63.3592
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever <UNK> .    200.0869
" My style of writing is very different from yours . "    84.3939
Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .    103.2435
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible .    144.5296
To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia .    132.1306
" You go to Brighton ! - - I would not trust you so near it as <UNK> <UNK> for fifty pounds !    144.4053
It only shews her being deficient in something herself - - sense or feeling . "    302.0658
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman .    106.4936
Bingley will not be detained in London by them . "    39.2412
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield .    93.3257
This was very amiable , but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any <UNK> of ; - - its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr . Collins's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .    162.4821
" Nothing child , nothing .    265.3102
" We never had any governess . "    52.4067
Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining - room , which <UNK> the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate .    183.9402
Mr . Bennet <UNK> his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do .    238.1905
Every thing that is charming !    58.6592
" I have not the smallest objection to <UNK> them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak .    25.4419
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort .    86.3967
At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their <UNK> she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the <UNK> and <UNK> civility of her    174.5177
husband .    29.3117
In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .    228.7472
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite <UNK> , saw it all with great delight .    259.7998
They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression .    151.4748
But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country .    149.2307
<UNK> his second daughter employed in <UNK> a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " I hope Mr . Bingley will like it Lizzy . "    120.4247
But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding .    61.2057
Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of you . "    37.3140
Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " Jane , I congratulate you .    49.5395
" If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there .    113.7309
She had scarcely <UNK> her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her ,    108.4670
he chose to <UNK> with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion .    98.9239
Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much relieved by <UNK> such different feelings .    202.2384
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . - - It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to    131.5783
form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .    299.2213
But really , Ma'am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . - - The last born has as good    109.5359
a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .    153.0061
and so she asked the two <UNK> to come , but <UNK> was ill , and so <UNK> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ?    213.7293
To Mrs . Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers .    169.6052
" <UNK> !    2520.4854
<UNK> different was the effect of a second perusal . - - How could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? - - He declared himself to have been totally <UNK> of her    77.4213
sister's attachment ; - - and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been . - - Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane . - - She felt that Jane's feelings , though <UNK> , were little displayed , and that    104.1332
there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great <UNK> .    204.0691
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very <UNK> bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them .    223.6163
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the <UNK> were silent .    1577.3644
And you are never to <UNK> out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . "    90.0085
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation .    58.1499
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no <UNK> in future to the impudence of an <UNK> man .    239.2380
I rather wonder now at your knowing any . "    207.1633
" I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her <UNK>    68.9812
; and if you can <UNK> it , do <UNK> the younger girls of running after the officers . - - And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady <UNK>    203.7077
. "    1.1836
said he , as he joined her .    24.0559
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling .    102.7682
" Good God !    298.8695
" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? "    59.9146
" Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . "    29.1130
It was all conjecture . "    44.8339
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former .    45.3325
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting .    140.1058
" From Mr . Collins !    25.3937
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his <UNK> for her as his patroness , <UNK> with a very good opinion of himself , of    135.5595
his authority as a clergyman , and his <UNK> as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and <UNK> , self - importance and humility .    275.3035
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be <UNK> ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry .    92.4739
" We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs . Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . "    53.2874
They are all for what they can get .    44.9319
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . "    35.0468
" It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should . "    34.9253
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and <UNK> ; and his civilities were worn out like his information .    320.9026
" What is it you mean ? "    30.4021
How well it <UNK> .    2157.1089
" Certainly , " he replied , <UNK> his lips .    119.8216
He was received by Mrs . Bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when <UNK> with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend .    118.7689
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . "    19.7163
Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many <UNK> , as they proceeded together up the great staircase    170.6827
.    N/A
" Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few <UNK> larger .    112.2370
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made .    86.7624
She has known him only a fortnight .    71.7443
Her mother's <UNK> , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the    140.5577
family .    8.4095
My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says .    57.4710
" My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . "    33.1563
They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good - humoured smile , " Come ,    49.3280
Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .    40.0136
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present <UNK> of good - will are highly <UNK> , and    213.5563
that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch .    131.7621
Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .    240.5978
" Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me .    92.0291
" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into . "    113.6457
" If he does not come to me , then , " said she , " I shall give him up for ever . "    15.9303
" And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always <UNK> books . "    113.9567
This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .    62.3961
" But people themselves <UNK> so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . "    242.5616
" Well , and what news does it bring ?    198.0739
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better .    121.7882
her liveliness had been never worse <UNK> .    1336.7054
She wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of <UNK> intelligence .    180.8775
It would have spared her , she thought , one <UNK> night out of two .    301.6675
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs . Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .    78.8056
There he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself .    35.9837
She had a sister married to a Mr . Philips , who had been a <UNK> to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade .    84.8558
" Oh !    6.1638
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal .    144.8003
The apothecary came , and having examined his <UNK> , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts    118.4335
.    N/A
" I should like it beyond any thing ! "    37.2550
" I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but it is wholly out of my power .    25.9976
" Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? "    23.9478
In the first place , she <UNK> in <UNK> the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr . Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and <UNK> , that the match might    93.6541
be broken off .    316.3514
" I am not afraid of you , " said he , <UNK> .    20.3012
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .    99.0950
no . "    29.2858
" And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ?    172.5166
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . "    249.2443
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together .    42.3810
Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .    160.6215
" Upon my word , " said her Ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . - - Pray , what is your age ? "    55.5819
Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs . F . gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W . never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to    155.1014
Colonel F . who instantly taking the alarm , set off from <UNK> . intending to trace their route .    775.7443
<UNK> men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . "    246.8378
Such were the kind of lamentations <UNK> perpetually through Longbourn - house .    1096.8439
What a fine thing for our girls ! "    121.5722
" And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason .    162.8800
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . - - We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . "    78.3837
" No , indeed .    12.5989
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .    77.3154
They were all astonished ; and Mr . Bennet , who could by no means wish for so <UNK> a return , immediately said , " But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here , my good sir ? - - You had better neglect your relations    104.7341
, than run the risk of offending your patroness . "    211.7547
The sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet <UNK> her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , to    130.0538
explain their <UNK> , and perhaps announce the marriage .    488.4865
<UNK> me farther particulars .    1281.6332
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn , and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .    125.8831
" It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . "    277.1779
On the following Monday , Mrs . Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn .    40.3767
" And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? "    259.6259
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr . Bingley's heart were entertained .    186.7430
I am sure my sisters must all envy me .    124.3134
They <UNK> behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , were to entertain each other .    147.1395
Their visits to Mrs . Philips were now <UNK> of the most interesting intelligence .    165.7843
Mrs . Hurst <UNK> with her sister , and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy's eyes were fixed on her .    161.5976
I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from you .    80.9880
It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .    52.6274
In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .    94.8046
As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . "    50.3645
Darcy shook his head in silent <UNK> .    533.4262
But now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in Lydia's marriage .    129.9825
Elizabeth would not oppose such an <UNK> - - and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by <UNK> employment the feelings which    163.5895
were divided between distress and diversion .    2513.3323
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , yet , for Elizabeth's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession .    89.1746
You will not find him more <UNK> spoken of by any one . "    111.9180
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .    103.8483
The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them .    54.7884
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . "    141.3769
If therefore she actually <UNK> in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . "    365.6369
At least , you should not remind your <UNK> of <UNK> him . "    311.1635
I dearly love a laugh . "    503.0319
He had found the law a most <UNK> study , and was now absolutely resolved on being <UNK> , if I would present him to the living in question - - of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had    117.0857
no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my <UNK> father's intentions .    282.5041
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband .    42.2040
She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .    177.0949
She liked him too little to care for his approbation .    73.0992
" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been <UNK> by the same authority .    197.1876
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many <UNK> , for the sake of <UNK> them . "    127.7764
And do you really love him quite well enough ?    229.4581
" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . "    49.5229
Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the <UNK> account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; - - but <UNK> them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two    167.0183
letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with <UNK> energy . - - Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs . Gardiner could not but be deeply affected .    97.5950
On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .    57.7952
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and <UNK> , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family .    183.0776
" Oh ! - - Your uncle ! - - He keeps a man - servant , does he ? - - I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things .    45.9709
He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling .    104.3056
I hope you have destroyed the letter .    71.3666
" I see your design , Bingley , " said his friend . - - " You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . "    48.1242
Your conduct would be quite as <UNK> on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were <UNK> your horse , a friend were to say , ' Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do    264.6250
it , you would probably not go - - and , at another word , might stay a month . "    95.5370
" You are uniformly charming ! "    60.8180
It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .    86.6727
" But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? "    77.5267
I hope they will not meet at all .    32.6888
But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good .    68.1587
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to Jane , and she <UNK> as to the greater probability of his coming there with    94.2333
his friend's permission , or being <UNK> enough to come without it .    197.0072
" <UNK> to me very often , my dear . "    57.1943
In pompous <UNK> on his side , and civil <UNK> on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton .    369.4708
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr . Darcy .    66.1239
" Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay    99.4076
in Hertfordshire .    81.3886
In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly <UNK> herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to satisfy .    85.6645
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness <UNK> in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and <UNK> , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .    225.9607
The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of <UNK> which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise <UNK> , he took his seat at the <UNK> of the table , by her ladyship's desire    76.3581
, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . - - He <UNK> , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir William , who was now enough recovered    172.1541
to <UNK> whatever his son in law said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear .    421.2780
But , Lizzy !    36.9172
" <UNK> !    2520.4866
and so extremely accomplished for her age !    650.7274
They were natural and just .    318.8169
For though <UNK> by his rank , it did not render him <UNK> ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body .    204.8527
" I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am not a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . "    71.8754
My dear Jane , Mr . Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who <UNK> him ,    68.5499
cannot have a proper way of thinking .    64.1178
The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles .    307.5333
I have not been in the habit of <UNK> disappointment . "    57.8161
Her performance on the piano - forte is <UNK> . "    119.3596
She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .    275.2585
As for Jane , her anxiety under this <UNK> was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth's ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of <UNK> , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .    149.1938
Elizabeth's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention !    539.3569
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that <UNK> us .    476.6682
Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and <UNK> a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design .    135.3045
I am sure he will be <UNK> happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the <UNK> for you . "    100.2542
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .    101.6419
He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support <UNK> .    139.9473
" Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , " said Bingley ; " but this was all lost upon me .    70.8925
She could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though    138.8308
her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .    150.9137
In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into    135.1544
engagements with each other , how can I promise to be <UNK> than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be <UNK> to resist ?    258.8158
" He must be an <UNK> , I think , " said she .    25.7652
They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his <UNK> , of every thing but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs . Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs . Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the    76.2058
subject .    16.7740
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be <UNK> .    84.1231
She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .    49.0240
The comfort to her , of the regiment's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .    273.7162
The letter was to this effect : " MY DEAR <UNK> , " I wish you joy .    86.9845
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement .    227.2604
But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . "    63.2386
" But so we all do .    111.5889
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might <UNK> his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it .    100.2406
mamma , do the people here <UNK> know I am married to - day ?    332.9834
Mr . Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .    107.2067
He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility .    206.6547
Seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's <UNK> .    132.8188
The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with <UNK> <UNK> through the neighbourhood .    598.5407
I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable <UNK> , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him .    130.3697
no . - - I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . "    40.3790
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it ; - - till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante .    152.6724
" I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring .    14.0699
The adieu is <UNK> itself .    4675.3882
" Her indifferent state of health unhappily <UNK> her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the <UNK> court of its brightest <UNK> .    484.0827
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her <UNK> of quadrille in the evening .    102.8127
To Mr . Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with <UNK> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again .    93.0571
" I wish it may . "    34.1109
They must have seen them together for ever . "    27.0451
" I have been used to consider poetry as the <UNK> of love , " said Darcy .    46.1093
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .    112.7208
" Did you go by the village of <UNK> ? "    133.5277
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .    130.8317
Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse - woman , walking was her only alternative .    124.5573
" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she .    36.1413
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of    124.5534
her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in <UNK> them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .    283.4271
And when her sisters <UNK> it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " Oh !    169.9666
" That is a failing indeed ! "    45.2157
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are <UNK> your time with me . "    174.2470
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .    130.9083
But I cannot - - I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .    93.8861
Mrs . Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . '    48.0539
" But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs . Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . "    27.2749
Not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , <UNK> to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a <UNK> <UNK> between them .    172.6464
I was afraid they might not ; and we <UNK> William <UNK> in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my <UNK> , and let my hand just rest    379.7736
upon the window <UNK> , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . "    252.3835
" Sometimes .    9896.5605
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene    112.8825
between Mr . Darcy and herself .    11.6413
But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . "    68.0819
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very    87.6673
minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .    94.1508
" I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried .    28.3286
Lord bless me !    275.1960
No principle of either , would be <UNK> by my marriage with Mr . Darcy .    92.4171
" Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? "    154.6667
You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer . "    56.9107
He was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their <UNK> to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would <UNK> .    262.1227
have you heard from my uncle ? "    25.6012
" If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very <UNK> diversion ,    49.9823
and perfectly <UNK> with the profession of a clergyman . - - I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in <UNK> too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to .    144.1939
He owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable .    90.9537
If it was not <UNK> for him to gain my affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? "    121.4425
" I see no occasion for that .    95.2951
The express was sent off directly .    187.6643
Mr . Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .    65.4790
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing .    82.1817
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .    134.5457
I cannot forget the follies and <UNK> of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself .    165.7330
Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy .    110.3163
" She did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go . "    16.5863
We will know where we have gone - - we will recollect what we have seen .    85.1350
His countenance rather gained in <UNK> ; and he scarcely opened his lips .    461.5290
" Lizzy , " said her father , " I have given him my consent .    14.1933
<UNK> to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he <UNK> most <UNK> to his book , and would not even look at her .    96.1238
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !    227.4546
" While Mary is <UNK> her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to Mr .    102.2002
He saw Wickham , and afterwards <UNK> on seeing Lydia .    263.4825
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though ,    71.9815
when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen .    113.1920
<UNK> one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have <UNK> .    116.7145
" And are they upon such terms as for her to <UNK> the real truth !    354.5421
" A man who has once been refused !    175.3517
Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is .    75.5394
it is just as he <UNK> .    121.5775
Very nonsensical to come at all !    183.9121
She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee <UNK> himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? "    126.1929
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . Reynolds was of no trifling nature .    312.2738
" <UNK> in other words , you are determined to have him .    139.3336
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she    60.3066
did , she accepted him .    64.9412
" Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . "    51.4349
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs . Philips's supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body .    74.2094
" Certainly , " replied Elizabeth - - " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .    24.1081
" Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling .    24.5343
" How can you contrive to write so even ? "    65.7230
that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . "    83.1064
All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of    137.4592
allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum .    274.5144
" Yes , " replied Wickham ; - - " his estate there is a noble one .    42.3666
Mr . Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs . Bennet .    51.2922
It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch - street , for the town of - - - - in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the <UNK> inn where Mr . Bennet's carriage was to    80.6937
meet them , they quickly perceived , in <UNK> of the <UNK> punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room up stairs .    268.1445
" And pray may I ask ? "    100.7665
Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed .    239.5575
Mrs . Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends .    36.8942
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .    96.1396
" If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . "    58.8818
Jane was distressed .    33.9396
She was ashamed to think how much .    49.2362
He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . "    15.9580
He , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry .    166.3352
I am sick of them all .    31.8083
The church ought to have been my profession - - I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . "    84.6380
Elizabeth hesitated , but her <UNK> <UNK> under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them .    186.8757
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and <UNK> <UNK> .    395.7535
At any rate , she cannot grow many <UNK> worse , without <UNK> us to <UNK> her up for the rest of her life . "    247.2942
And it is the more to be <UNK> , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte <UNK> me , that this <UNK> of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for    116.9373
the consolation of yourself and Mrs . Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an <UNK> , at so early an age .    65.5188
" It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .    44.1497
Her reflections were in general satisfactory .    300.1932
Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . "    124.1985
" I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . "    100.7276
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for    101.0591
though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively <UNK> since the adventure of Wednesday .    350.4646
" But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied Darcy .    122.6789
The garden <UNK> to the road , the house standing in it , the <UNK> pales and the <UNK> <UNK> , every thing declared they were <UNK> .    493.5028
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to <UNK> Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .    109.0543
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman - like man - - he is a great friend of Darcy's . "    43.0242
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate .    168.8999
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas .    102.0765
Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it <UNK> hard .    416.2009
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one .    78.2765
Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed <UNK> away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .    169.3491
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .    235.5786
You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people .    47.4559
I shall go distracted . "    56.8235
I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . "    137.3540
When Mr . Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .    112.4593
" Indeed I could not .    37.7596
How are they even to be discovered ?    88.6127
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr . Darcy he <UNK> with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .    172.9202
Here consequently was an <UNK> subject of discourse .    2280.0532
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs . Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she <UNK> the <UNK> .    137.1095
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .    134.1010
<UNK> him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ?    83.9328
He is gone to my father already .    101.1747
My dear Charles , what do you mean ? "    29.3371
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .    91.1020
He heard her with astonishment .    54.9316
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . "    311.6438
Yet , indeed , I am in earnest .    48.7707
It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of <UNK> interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .    415.5585
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment <UNK> her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again .    194.5277
how I laughed !    125.7312
She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . "    93.5889
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay .    43.0258
I have by no means done .    53.8100
How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves .    221.6852
When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and <UNK> she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small .    105.1083
how I wanted you ! "    30.4429
At that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs . Hurst and Elizabeth herself .    52.1668
By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting <UNK> and wrong , and me most unhappy .    389.9713
They have at least that advantage . "    68.1056
Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .    125.7089
I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte's marriage .    215.0162
Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , <UNK> Elizabeth !    353.9842
" It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . "    39.1720
" With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will <UNK> it . "    207.2132
Mr . Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an <UNK> .    90.4973
But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a <UNK> <UNK> again . "    181.2742
But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .    49.5069
It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <UNK> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .    122.3734
" Yes , and I had heard it before .    18.1319
Then pray speak aloud .    2370.5298
If he had another motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him .    38.1894
yes - - I understand you perfectly . "    23.7309
such an openness and gentleness in his manner . "    76.8714
He begged pardon for having displeased her .    457.4408
They came .    108.8689
I am quite well .    17.8964
" You are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! - - always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! - - If my vanity had taken a <UNK> turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it    98.8291
is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best <UNK> . "    202.5522
I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . "    24.8544
Come be quick , be quick !    1387.0015
This must be the <UNK> falsehood ! "    219.4493
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so .    40.4268
Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh .    69.6403
Oh !    4.2120
He <UNK> out half his words , and <UNK> the rest . "    313.1150
She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she <UNK> about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two .    140.8816
Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can <UNK> more than one witness of <UNK> veracity .    196.8834
my dear Charlotte , - - impossible ! "    31.2658
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , - - that Mr . Bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public .    81.5885
She was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so <UNK> a tone , as marked her self - importance , and brought Mr . Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed    109.1980
Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented .    57.3122
My sister , who is more than ten years my <UNK> , was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .    81.1880
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were <UNK> over to the <UNK> , who met them at the hall door .    154.9504
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy .    30.4521
Mr . Collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give .    216.7375
" But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . "    49.9830
There was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies .    284.7600
When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention .    70.2045
But Georgiana would not join her .    104.9644
But as no such delicacy <UNK> her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill    174.7260
used .    75.6252
Not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves .    313.2231
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a <UNK> !    164.4357
The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .    161.5544
For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "    133.0055
She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " Now , I do insist upon    78.7902
it , that you , all of you , hold your <UNK> , and let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . "    73.3716
He had to be sure done much .    201.6554
you are a great deal too <UNK> you know , to like people in general .    165.1827
" Next time you call , " said she , " I hope we shall be more lucky . "    46.2084
" I am not going to run away , <UNK> , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . "    53.1087
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?    205.4997
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them <UNK> silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever <UNK> between them again .    227.0936
When you told Mrs . Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself - - and yet what is there so very <UNK> in    124.7778
a precipitance which must leave very necessary business <UNK> , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? "    377.3281
He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not <UNK> .    81.1312
Bennet . - - They had several children .    96.8307
Mrs . Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father's life time .    58.0169
As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more .    140.9590
She had high <UNK> spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle's good <UNK> and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance .    166.9418
However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham .    53.1657
* * * * * " Good gracious ! "    9.6440
When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing - room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen    60.2925
them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared .    71.0760
It is impossible for me to be impartial .    38.0088
Miss Bingley's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .    95.1457
In <UNK> her recollection of Pemberley , with the minute description which Wickham could give , and in <UNK> her <UNK> of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was <UNK> both him and herself .    464.4604
Mr . Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete .    104.7871
" I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time .    73.9871
My temper I dare not vouch for . - - It is I believe too little yielding - - certainly too little for the convenience of the world .    80.5063
Very well .    97.5438
