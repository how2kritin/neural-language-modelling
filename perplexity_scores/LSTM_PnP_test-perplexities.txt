<BOS> Hurst ' s gown - - - - " Here she was interrupted again .    40.9490
<BOS> I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without <UNK> them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable .    66.9871
<BOS> I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . " " Are you , indeed ?    21.2205
<BOS> Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real <UNK> ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body .    75.4898
<BOS> He had been some time with Mr . Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on <UNK> that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning .    59.2429
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> How you must have hated me after that evening ? " " <UNK> you ! I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . " " I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley .    70.2461
<BOS> how can it affect them ? " " My dear Mr . Bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . " " Is that his design in settling here ? " " <UNK> ! nonsense , how can you talk so ! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . " " I see no occasion for that .    35.1703
<BOS> It is from my cousin , Mr . Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . " " Oh ! my dear , " cried his wife , " I cannot bear to hear that mentioned .    22.4812
<BOS> Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it <UNK> hard .    245.9249
<BOS> You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! I dare say he often <UNK> worse things said than I am going to say .    131.7032
<BOS> May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? " " They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with <UNK> and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as <UNK> an air as possible . " Mr . Bennet ' s expectations were fully answered .    176.2120
<BOS> Darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it .    38.0862
<BOS> I do think it is the <UNK> thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . " Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail .    59.9731
<BOS> Her enquiries after her sister were not very <UNK> answered .    153.3792
<BOS> " He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle .    57.1791
<BOS> What shall we do with him ?    53.9515
<BOS> I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . " " Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . " This information made Elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor Miss Bingley .    71.5158
<BOS> She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it .    62.3417
<BOS> How can they suit each other ? - - Do you know Mr . Bingley ? " " Not at all . " " He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man .    23.1370
<BOS> Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of <UNK> should not be broken in on .    324.2581
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me .    70.4124
<BOS> The families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .    165.4743
<BOS> He began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others .    54.6869
<BOS> They entered it in one of its <UNK> points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , <UNK> over a wide extent .    344.6912
<BOS> I am sure you must feel it so . " " Oh ! no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both .    51.1725
<BOS> Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him .    48.4644
<BOS> While Sir William was with them , Mr . Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his <UNK> , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which <UNK> the road .    83.2101
<BOS> I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . " In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make her resigned .    71.5868
<BOS> The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr . Collins .    25.3428
<BOS> I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she <UNK> more ; and though Mrs .    73.5266
<BOS> She has a very good notion of <UNK> , though her taste is not equal to Anne ' s .    63.9034
<BOS> I hope we may often meet again . " Elizabeth smiled .    23.4667
<BOS> At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never have <UNK> such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s <UNK> .    58.5995
<BOS> It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living .    57.8498
<BOS> They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .    86.8682
<BOS> " If it were merely a fine house <UNK> <UNK> , " said she , " I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful .    96.3077
<BOS> If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , <UNK> the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement .    182.8513
<BOS> A most delightful place ! - - <UNK> Parsonage House ! It would have suited me in every respect . " " How should you have liked making sermons ? " " <UNK> well .    165.5009
<BOS> I send no compliments to your mother .    42.8606
<BOS> Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire .    120.3200
<BOS> It had come with a <UNK> from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be <UNK> , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham .    95.9095
<BOS> and Mrs .    11.2542
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> The rector of a parish has much to do . - - In the first place , he must make such an <UNK> for <UNK> as may be <UNK> to himself and not <UNK> to his patron .    196.1893
<BOS> Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency .    49.8515
<BOS> Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ?    170.0452
<BOS> It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers .    29.1325
<BOS> Bennet , for many years after Lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would .    38.6032
<BOS> But Mrs .    9.9560
<BOS> He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could <UNK> her with the hope of <UNK> his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or <UNK> it .    319.7207
<BOS> It was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a <UNK> cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent .    72.1450
<BOS> Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard .    74.2347
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody .    37.0288
<BOS> Bennet , " that is very unlucky . " " Can I have the carriage ? " said Jane .    18.9714
<BOS> You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his <UNK> .    95.9118
<BOS> When Mr . Collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort <UNK> , and by Charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .    93.3364
<BOS> Mr . Darcy replied with great <UNK> , " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . " " Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! " repeated Miss Bingley .    53.2547
<BOS> " Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself .    15.8580
<BOS> She longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mrs .    23.6335
<BOS> Collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr . Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home .    60.6052
<BOS> They <UNK> every attempt of Mrs .    198.9403
<BOS> A person may be proud without being vain .    100.8045
<BOS> In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend .    124.7577
<BOS> They saw him often , and to his other <UNK> was now added that of general <UNK> .    268.8175
<BOS> * * * * * In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr . Darcy <UNK> also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme .    49.8930
<BOS> Elizabeth noticed every sentence <UNK> the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal .    149.6676
<BOS> I wonder he does not marry , to secure a <UNK> convenience of that kind .    91.1898
<BOS> The morrow produced no <UNK> of Mrs .    199.1234
<BOS> We must not make him desperate . " The tumult of Elizabeth ' s mind was <UNK> by this conversation .    50.3856
<BOS> What say you , Mary ?    82.3396
<BOS> Bennet was <UNK> in her acknowledgments .    153.7623
<BOS> " You certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . " " I should be sorry indeed , if it were .    32.2744
<BOS> Mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral <UNK> from the evil before them .    141.4216
<BOS> In the former were many good <UNK> ; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some <UNK> of Miss Darcy ' s , in <UNK> , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible .    119.2425
<BOS> I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the <UNK> .    27.2273
<BOS> They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .    60.3157
<BOS> Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " " Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . - - Will you hear it ? " " Most willingly . " " You shall have it in few words .    62.2979
<BOS> The happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do .    109.5261
<BOS> There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself .    112.8092
<BOS> By nature <UNK> , friendly and obliging , his presentation at St . James ' s had made him <UNK> .    175.1093
<BOS> " Very well - - and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " I have , Sir . " " Very well .    29.3084
<BOS> I declare I do not know a more <UNK> object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do . " Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh .    83.2081
<BOS> He was on one side of her mother .    16.6617
<BOS> is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared <UNK> .    141.1369
<BOS> " How good it was in you , my dear Mr . Bennet ! But I knew I should persuade you at last .    31.2550
<BOS> But still he would be her husband . - - Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune , and however <UNK> of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .    334.8916
<BOS> Bennet <UNK> up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good <UNK> .    73.3992
<BOS> You must not disappoint your father . " " My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . " " Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . " " Well , then , you need not be under any alarm .    35.9266
<BOS> She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . " The effect was immediate .    72.6401
<BOS> They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when Kitty left them , she went <UNK> on with him alone .    117.5057
<BOS> Mr . Wickham began the subject himself .    32.4635
<BOS> <UNK> <UNK> the face of Mrs .    477.1593
<BOS> After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss Bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour .    81.0316
<BOS> But we are all liable to error .    67.8064
<BOS> I hope he will overlook it .    36.4758
<BOS> His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most <UNK> shewn .    189.0548
<BOS> He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest <UNK> of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St . James ' s , with very decent composure .    80.7481
<BOS> He heard her attentively , and then said , " Lydia will never be easy till she has <UNK> herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . " " If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . " " <UNK> arisen ! " repeated Mr . Bennet .    72.7376
<BOS> The <UNK> of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl . - - Oh ! how acutely did she now feel it .    161.1222
<BOS> First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and <UNK> , of my room .    116.5708
<BOS> Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however <UNK> they may be returned .    121.4228
<BOS> He must know that she was as amiable and <UNK> as we have found her . " " But does Lydia know nothing of this ?    54.8812
<BOS> The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation .    83.6998
<BOS> Mr . Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a <UNK> season , made her feel that the <UNK> , <UNK> , most thread - bare <UNK> might be rendered interesting by the skill of the <UNK> .    187.8874
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Miss Darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , <UNK> herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and <UNK> , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .    81.6886
<BOS> My mother was in <UNK> , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done ! But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my <UNK> . " " Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you .    67.0827
<BOS> <UNK> must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections .    153.4232
<BOS> Elizabeth <UNK> out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty <UNK> , hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her .    114.0551
<BOS> Mr . Hurst and Mr . Bingley were at <UNK> , and Mrs .    21.0213
<BOS> " I knew , " said he , " that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary .    24.3759
<BOS> " I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life - - - - " Mrs .    25.9546
<BOS> As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several <UNK> in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a <UNK> glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have <UNK> its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination .    172.7320
<BOS> " You write uncommonly fast . " " You are mistaken .    37.3962
<BOS> You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created . " " I am , " said he , with a firm voice .    29.4888
<BOS> She felt it to be the probable consequence of her <UNK> to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in it .    53.8911
<BOS> " I see what you are feeling , " replied Charlotte , - - " you must be surprised , very much surprised , - - so lately as Mr . Collins was wishing to marry you .    30.3768
<BOS> " Lizzy is only <UNK> in such matters as these .    98.2345
<BOS> She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him .    30.4064
<BOS> <UNK> Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed .    60.0034
<BOS> Is not general incivility the very <UNK> of love ? " " Oh , yes ! - - of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt .    69.6244
<BOS> You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas .    66.1402
<BOS> " They are going to be <UNK> near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! It would be such a <UNK> scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all .    76.9632
<BOS> Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with <UNK> smiles and tears .    80.7134
<BOS> Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs .    81.0555
<BOS> Philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces .    111.6414
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> " I am sure there is not on his .    18.9635
<BOS> You may ask questions , which I shall not choose to answer . " " This is not to be borne .    30.6981
<BOS> Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is .    317.3814
<BOS> But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves .    55.1547
<BOS> With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and <UNK> <UNK> .    313.0228
<BOS> The possibility of Mr . Collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the <UNK> of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " <UNK> to Mr . Collins ! my dear Charlotte , - - impossible ! " The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had <UNK> in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected ,    95.1315
she soon <UNK> her composure , and <UNK> replied , " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? - - Do you think it incredible that Mr . Collins should be able to <UNK> any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable <UNK> that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness .    58.5918
<BOS> " What is Mr . Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ?    18.0321
<BOS> He had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .    59.3189
<BOS> And on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved <UNK> to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " The men shan ' t come and part us , I am determined .    92.8072
<BOS> If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a <UNK> of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once .    77.4505
<BOS> But , my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley <UNK> you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . " " If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy .    59.9096
<BOS> " Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? " said Miss Bingley ; " will she be as tall as I am ? " " I think she will .    50.8876
<BOS> Nothing could be more delightful ! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively hopes of Mr . Bingley ' s heart were entertained .    104.2648
<BOS> " Can it be possible that he will marry her ? " " Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister .    28.5193
<BOS> It is because he will not give himself the trouble . " " I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before .    62.5007
<BOS> or under what <UNK> , can you here impose upon others ? " " You take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said Darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour .    136.3448
<BOS> Gardiner .    26.0506
<BOS> Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then was .    68.7436
<BOS> " There were some very strong objections against the lady , " were Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London .    167.9213
<BOS> Her astonishment at his coming - - at his coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first <UNK> his altered behaviour in Derbyshire .    103.5441
<BOS> Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . " As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr . Bingley , and the <UNK> of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .    87.5208
<BOS> I am going to <UNK> <UNK> , and if you cannot guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel .    86.1790
<BOS> Have you had any <UNK> ?    243.3743
<BOS> I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . " " The letter shall certainly be <UNK> , if you believe it <UNK> to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <UNK> , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that <UNK> . " " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . " " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so .    91.5410
<BOS> Why does she not come in ? " " Oh ! Charlotte says , she hardly ever does .    60.4084
<BOS> Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress . - - But I will not <UNK> you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks .    152.6366
<BOS> Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match .    126.2478
<BOS> She had very little notice from any but him .    70.5226
<BOS> The gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr . Wickham walked into the room , Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration .    54.2748
<BOS> He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her ; his style was not <UNK> , but haughty .    143.8494
<BOS> Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . " " Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr . Bingley to her . " " Impossible , Mr . Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " " I honour your <UNK> .    34.7467
<BOS> He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <UNK> and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune .    104.1154
<BOS> You promised me to insist upon her marrying him . " " My dear , " replied her husband , " I have two small favours to request .    37.3766
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us .    33.3746
<BOS> She saw with the <UNK> eye of fancy , the <UNK> of that <UNK> bathing place covered with officers .    792.3517
<BOS> Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton .    33.0480
<BOS> " Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs .    36.8260
<BOS> We must not all expect Jane ' s good fortune . " " True , " said Mr . Bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may <UNK> you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . " Mr . Wickham ' s society was of material service in <UNK> the gloom , which the late <UNK> occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family .    86.0465
<BOS> You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother ' s permission for this address .    110.0890
<BOS> By this time she is actually with them ! If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " " We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said Jane : " I hope and trust they will yet be happy .    81.9234
<BOS> It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends <UNK> <UNK> by the more natural influence of Jane ' s attractions .    113.4523
<BOS> There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs .    28.1254
<BOS> Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of <UNK> , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued .    99.4538
<BOS> It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . " " Yes , very indifferent indeed , " said Elizabeth , laughingly .    80.1460
<BOS> Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and <UNK> of my son - in - law .    140.6637
<BOS> But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information .    61.7359
<BOS> And her neighbours at Lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time .    230.7486
<BOS> With a book he was <UNK> of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations .    106.9762
<BOS> Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . " Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr . Bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them .    31.5357
<BOS> Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a - year .    82.8705
<BOS> Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly <UNK> .    45.7190
<BOS> Bennet was <UNK> to her usual <UNK> serenity , and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the <UNK> - office , another regiment should be quartered in Meryton .    238.2828
<BOS> I hope you have destroyed the letter .    46.8335
<BOS> " You are a good girl ; " he replied , " and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled .    22.1134
<BOS> And , above all things , keep Mr . Bennet from <UNK> .    158.6963
<BOS> Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone .    81.8451
<BOS> Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . " Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she <UNK> this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation .    74.6827
<BOS> At such a distance as that , you know , things are <UNK> misrepresented . " " Certainly , " he replied , <UNK> his lips .    82.8609
<BOS> She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , <UNK> to her , cried in a half whisper , " I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! - - What do you think has happened this morning ? - - Mr . Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . " Charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room , where Mrs .    44.0208
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> His friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in ten days time .    77.2631
<BOS> But not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little <UNK> , preparing to oblige the company .    134.0071
<BOS> <UNK> as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none .    95.7460
<BOS> She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an <UNK> of Mr . Darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some <UNK> of the latter with regard to new furniture .    84.1645
<BOS> Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs .    61.9314
<BOS> In this danger Kitty is also comprehended .    210.3360
<BOS> They may be there , though for the purpose of <UNK> , for no more <UNK> purpose .    144.3793
<BOS> It is Mr . Wickham ' s intention to go into the <UNK> ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army .    61.2433
<BOS> At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family .    48.2954
<BOS> He readily agreed to it .    58.3473
<BOS> He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to <UNK> ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand .    74.4088
<BOS> They agree with me in <UNK> that this false step in one daughter , will be <UNK> to the <UNK> of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself <UNK> says , will connect themselves with such a family .    203.2289
<BOS> And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty .    29.5813
<BOS> Hill began instantly to express her joy .    117.2226
<BOS> It was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .    58.3868
<BOS> She is a very <UNK> foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will make her know it . " " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she is really <UNK> and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .    60.2083
<BOS> Her colour changed , and she said no more .    41.2936
<BOS> She could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his <UNK> powers had gained him in the <UNK> .    83.5782
<BOS> Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his <UNK> and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . " " But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " " It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister    61.9595
' s sense of <UNK> and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt .    134.6803
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> But his anger , I am persuaded , <UNK> no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments .    60.4202
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> It was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried .    41.6568
<BOS> It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in <UNK> them , she saw there was less captivating <UNK> in Colonel Fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind .    108.6531
<BOS> GARDINER . " Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham ' s removal from the - - - - shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do .    30.1262
<BOS> Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship .    115.1264
<BOS> There is not one of his <UNK> or servants but what will give him a good name .    76.4656
<BOS> But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw - - and if he becomes really attached to me - - I believe it will be better that he should not .    49.8247
<BOS> There were two <UNK> of Lady Catherine to require them , for Mr . Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , Lord - - - - and to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr . Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him .    58.2937
<BOS> In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and <UNK> society . " " But people themselves <UNK> so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . " " Yes , indeed , " cried Mrs .    99.7363
<BOS> Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr . Wickham .    72.1440
<BOS> What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had <UNK> <UNK> only four months ago , would now have been <UNK> and gratefully received ! He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex .    165.0538
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> However , I recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr . Darcy might have done as well . " " Mr . Darcy ! " repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement .    52.0415
<BOS> for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts . " Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how .    237.5676
<BOS> Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any <UNK> circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ; her <UNK> and steady candour always <UNK> for <UNK> , and urged the possibility of mistakes - - but by everybody else Mr . Darcy was condemned as the worst of men .    221.3891
<BOS> With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round .    61.9165
<BOS> His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr . Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate <UNK> advantage , in <UNK> of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited .    154.1126
<BOS> Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves .    86.0079
<BOS> I enquired after their brother , of course .    57.3854
<BOS> His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . " " To be sure , Lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good .    40.8011
<BOS> But her commendation , though <UNK> her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr . Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship ' s praise into his own hands .    88.0384
<BOS> And if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as <UNK> does not object to the <UNK> <UNK> , there will be very good room for one of you - - and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . " " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must <UNK> by our original plan . " Lady Catherine seemed resigned .    81.5463
<BOS> The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever .    59.7943
<BOS> On the strength of Darcy ' s regard Bingley had the firmest <UNK> , and of his judgment the highest opinion .    94.3623
<BOS> Who should suffer but myself ?    269.2439
<BOS> Nor was Darcy ' s <UNK> , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery .    103.6171
<BOS> That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! Oh , Lydia ! " " I comfort myself with thinking , " replied Jane , " that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her .    55.0775
<BOS> I write rather slowly . " " How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! <UNK> of business too ! How odious I should think them ! " " It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . " " Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . " " I have already told her so once , by your desire . " " I am afraid you do not like your pen .    74.4337
<BOS> One day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance ; and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual .    74.4430
<BOS> Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ?    334.0680
<BOS> Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London .    23.0237
<BOS> I promised them so <UNK> ! What will Wickham say ?    451.1689
<BOS> She had gained her point , and had time to consider of it .    49.3780
<BOS> Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs .    61.0311
<BOS> Their fortune on both sides is splendid .    439.0952
<BOS> We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . " " <UNK> ! " cried Bingley .    41.2170
<BOS> In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less <UNK> whisper ; for to her <UNK> vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them .    71.0405
<BOS> I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him .    92.2571
<BOS> " I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself .    105.7882
<BOS> They must be a great loss to your family . " In Darcy ' s presence she dared not mention Wickham ' s name ; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was <UNK> in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress ; but , <UNK> herself <UNK> to <UNK> the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone .    119.9071
<BOS> A flirt too , in the worst and <UNK> degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and <UNK> of her mind , wholly unable to <UNK> off any portion of that universal contempt which her <UNK> for admiration will excite .    402.9556
<BOS> Bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own .    65.8453
<BOS> We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might <UNK> to all the world ; a sense of very great ill <UNK> , and most painful regrets at his being what he is .    119.4444
<BOS> They are gone off together from Brighton .    39.8446
<BOS> In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other .    27.5023
<BOS> I need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so <UNK> dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable .    111.7260
<BOS> " But the wife of Mr . Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . " " <UNK> , <UNK> girl ! I am ashamed of you ! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ?    85.8343
<BOS> " Lizzy , you must not do so .    22.0926
<BOS> Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to <UNK> on Mrs .    75.2260
<BOS> You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are <UNK> your time with me . " Mr . Bingley followed his advice .    89.7330
<BOS> Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the <UNK> which Bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar .    76.2133
<BOS> He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . " " Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few <UNK> larger .    58.3974
<BOS> A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .    108.9985
<BOS> Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , <UNK> had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage .    113.2695
<BOS> That his anger could be carried to such a point of <UNK> resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem <UNK> , <UNK> all that she could believe possible .    223.4336
<BOS> Bingley was punctual to his <UNK> ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on .    57.5577
<BOS> Mr . Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required .    119.4468
<BOS> As it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the <UNK> of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery .    96.5291
<BOS> " Good gracious ! Lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! Mr . Darcy ! Who would have thought it ! And is it really true ?    87.3470
<BOS> It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of <UNK> , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .    148.5091
<BOS> Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband .    24.8750
<BOS> During dinner , Mr . Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to <UNK> , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness .    58.4361
<BOS> Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys .    56.0864
<BOS> Bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom .    43.9505
<BOS> Mr . Collins made his declaration in form .    46.2313
<BOS> <UNK> and <UNK> I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .    420.5725
<BOS> I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . " " But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . " " Let me be <UNK> understood .    82.6871
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents .    62.3815
<BOS> His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his <UNK> on mine , made every thing easy .    166.1832
<BOS> All Elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again .    125.6724
<BOS> And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ?    108.7471
<BOS> I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference .    69.1979
<BOS> Mr . Darcy was <UNK> him with <UNK> wonder , and when at last Mr . Collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility .    102.5286
<BOS> Miss Bingley ' s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most <UNK> , she even shook hands with the former . - - Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits .    61.0901
<BOS> Elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .    112.3153
<BOS> And when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man .    90.3651
<BOS> Wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Mrs .    102.8532
<BOS> " It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the - - - - shire .    46.6960
<BOS> Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to <UNK> her mother ' s schemes .    55.6622
<BOS> Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two <UNK> with Jane again , and the two <UNK> with Lizzy , and the <UNK> - - - - " " If he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! For God ' s sake , say no more of his partners .    80.8489
<BOS> They must have seen them together for ever . " " Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm .    59.2440
<BOS> Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .    131.7197
<BOS> That he was surprised by the <UNK> was evident ; he <UNK> it however with <UNK> , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr . Gardiner .    78.7931
<BOS> Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from Pemberley .    60.7351
<BOS> Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections .    181.8361
<BOS> This idea <UNK> while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them .    468.5646
<BOS> The moment of her <UNK> from him was ecstacy .    143.9085
<BOS> We do not suffer by accident .    58.2203
<BOS> Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . " The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .    105.7088
<BOS> Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first .    57.9408
<BOS> In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost .    52.5639
<BOS> Gardiner was so little to be trusted . " " You must not blame my aunt .    25.8823
<BOS> " Not at all .    20.9880
<BOS> She was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little <UNK> expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .    117.3243
<BOS> She turned from sister to sister , <UNK> their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there .    101.6328
<BOS> Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves .    116.4779
<BOS> I am always glad to get a young person well placed out .    68.5333
<BOS> Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ; and Jane more especially , who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the <UNK> , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <UNK> .    126.5474
<BOS> The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself <UNK> in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty .    71.3500
<BOS> He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way .    99.0054
<BOS> " Now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy .    28.1074
<BOS> Are the others coming out ? " " I do not know .    27.6871
<BOS> Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy .    80.8970
<BOS> Bennet ' s best comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer .    26.8499
<BOS> <UNK> Lady Catherine as well as you can .    77.9734
<BOS> She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a <UNK> light , it is certainly a very good match for her . " " It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . " " An easy distance do you call it ?    52.3855
<BOS> " Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude <UNK> him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an <UNK> , conceited woman . " " I believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied Wickham ; " I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were <UNK> and insolent .    64.5909
<BOS> " Nay , " said Elizabeth , " this is not fair .    15.5194
<BOS> Is nothing due to me on that score ?    176.9454
<BOS> A clergyman like you must marry . - - <UNK> properly , chuse a <UNK> for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way .    209.4534
<BOS> Oh ! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! " Wickham , Lydia , were all forgotten .    48.6324
<BOS> What made you so <UNK> of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ?    132.1870
<BOS> It was an earnest , <UNK> <UNK> , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .    191.3192
<BOS> Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole .    69.4413
<BOS> They could describe an entertainment with <UNK> , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .    453.2596
<BOS> Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ' s way . " Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <UNK> .    56.2242
<BOS> <UNK> at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life .    130.9671
<BOS> Elizabeth most <UNK> consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes .    163.6787
<BOS> Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters .    22.3899
<BOS> He has not an ill - natured look .    32.3289
<BOS> Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his <UNK> were at the same time so vague and <UNK> , that her mother , though often <UNK> , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last .    98.3484
<BOS> Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous .    148.0285
<BOS> What are men to <UNK> and mountains ?    548.0654
<BOS> " I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried .    18.7949
<BOS> Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party .    65.1487
<BOS> Jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no <UNK> on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved .    127.2363
<BOS> Elizabeth was delighted .    25.8013
<BOS> If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . " " What you ask , " said Elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr . Darcy had much better finish his letter . " Mr . Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter .    35.0280
<BOS> I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . " Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business .    48.0311
<BOS> I speak <UNK> .    324.0326
<BOS> I only hope they may have half my good luck .    65.9183
<BOS> There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . " " I am very sensible , madam , of the <UNK> to my fair cousins , - - and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and <UNK> .    92.8690
<BOS> Her affections had been continually <UNK> , but never without an object .    120.5421
<BOS> " And is this all ? " cried Elizabeth .    14.0520
<BOS> Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . " " Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget .    96.3574
<BOS> Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight .    104.4527
<BOS> She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle .    42.6705
<BOS> I am not ashamed of having been mistaken - - or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters .    35.1578
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> He had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear .    42.6884
<BOS> His complexion became pale with anger , and the <UNK> of his mind was visible in every feature .    148.5108
<BOS> She answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " My eldest sister has been in town these three months .    34.7173
<BOS> She shall hear my opinion . " Mrs .    24.8247
<BOS> But make a virtue of it by all means .    85.2778
<BOS> No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there .    508.0556
<BOS> She was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . - - It now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .    156.1743
<BOS> But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ' s <UNK> again . " His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the <UNK> gentlemen , on his returning to Netherfield .    119.1382
<BOS> The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than <UNK> .    147.6952
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> At length the chaise arrived , the <UNK> were <UNK> on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready .    180.7045
<BOS> She has been allowed to <UNK> of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way .    133.3592
<BOS> Why did the <UNK> ever let her go out of their sight ?    210.5046
<BOS> They were ignorant , idle , and vain .    31.1836
<BOS> The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in <UNK> it .    213.1681
<BOS> There was no want of discourse .    15.2767
<BOS> " Well , well , and so Mr . Bingley is coming down , sister , " ( for Mrs .    46.5431
<BOS> " Gracechurch - street , <UNK> .    122.2451
<BOS> I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . " " Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in <UNK> affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?    109.6294
<BOS> <UNK> me farther particulars .    504.5703
<BOS> He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively <UNK> since the adventure of Wednesday .    116.2591
<BOS> Could there be finer symptoms ?    988.3587
<BOS> I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . " " Ah ! you do not know what I suffer . " " But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . " " It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . " " <UNK> upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . " Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , <UNK> humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had    69.9078
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .    39.7086
<BOS> Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some <UNK> , has abilities which Mr . Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . " When she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr . Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been <UNK> governed by this worst kind of pride , and <UNK> by the wish    113.5341
of retaining Mr . Bingley for his sister .    32.0313
<BOS> But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible .    39.4275
<BOS> Jane was not happy .    34.4639
<BOS> They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain .    42.7181
<BOS> " I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle .    43.1443
<BOS> I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude .    126.8031
<BOS> She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always <UNK> about from one place to another , and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be .    54.9810
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> " I am sure , " said she , " I cried for two days together when Colonel <UNK> ' s regiment went away .    33.7158
<BOS> If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a <UNK> as that , it might be of <UNK> consequence .    137.2561
<BOS> To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had <UNK> ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <UNK> , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what Jane felt for Bingley .    107.2626
<BOS> Gardiner then <UNK> her niece on Wickham ' s <UNK> , and complimented her on bearing it so well .    207.5789
<BOS> The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs .    65.0272
<BOS> Bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy .    63.1962
<BOS> But she is too much like her brother , - - very , very proud . - - As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement .    78.6471
<BOS> Mr . Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the <UNK> of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began .    70.0551
<BOS> Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed .    247.9014
<BOS> " Yes - - if Darcy does not put it off again .    36.0392
<BOS> You see on what a footing we are .    203.0464
<BOS> You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that <UNK> is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . " " I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied Jane , " and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together .    85.9699
<BOS> Mr . Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day .    71.1754
<BOS> But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them .    253.7861
<BOS> Her <UNK> had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , " I can guess the subject of your <UNK> . " " I should imagine not . " " You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner - - in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion .    76.1620
<BOS> Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner . ' Those were your words .    173.3969
<BOS> I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs .    46.7558
<BOS> They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother .    113.3492
<BOS> " For my own part , " she <UNK> , " I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her .    35.9311
<BOS> They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain . " With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise <UNK> by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did <UNK> and <UNK> pass away .    221.1222
<BOS> " I do not get on at all .    18.5208
<BOS> Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth .    61.5850
<BOS> You know not what you are about . " Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the <UNK> change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the <UNK> of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did <UNK> her father ' s <UNK> , and <UNK> him to the match .    121.9465
<BOS> The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s <UNK> her coming so far alone .    195.1693
<BOS> On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr . Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared ; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he <UNK> <UNK> necessary .    151.7476
<BOS> And who knows what may happen ?    83.1406
<BOS> " Indeed , Mr . Bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! " " My dear , do not give way to such <UNK> thoughts .    37.0024
<BOS> Do not distress me by the idea .    62.3986
<BOS> You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she <UNK> she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . " Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication .    86.6632
<BOS> Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the <UNK> and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .    40.1755
<BOS> or had you intended any more serious consequence ? " " My real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me .    100.6768
<BOS> I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . " She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word .    63.2452
<BOS> Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her .    84.1237
<BOS> " Of music ! Then pray speak aloud .    348.2040
<BOS> We now come to the point .    32.9111
<BOS> Mr . Collins then returned to Elizabeth .    19.0943
<BOS> The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence . - - " He is now gone into the army , " she added , " but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . " Mrs .    30.3412
<BOS> It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you .    56.8163
<BOS> She tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished <UNK> of integrity or benevolence , that might <UNK> him from the attacks of Mr . Darcy ; or at least , by the <UNK> of virtue , <UNK> for those <UNK> errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance .    272.6016
<BOS> " This is wholly unexpected .    37.5246
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off .    46.9514
<BOS> She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; <UNK> and <UNK> her by <UNK> .    388.1398
<BOS> There is nothing he would not do for her . " The picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed - rooms , were all that remained to be shewn .    78.6642
<BOS> Is not he a charming man ?    78.4324
<BOS> He took the hint , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " That will do extremely well , child .    92.9400
<BOS> One came from her books , and the other from her toilette .    64.1475
<BOS> But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying - - and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of <UNK> a wife , as I certainly did . " The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : " My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example    132.9137
of matrimony in his parish .    76.3862
<BOS> Elizabeth immediately began playing again .    88.7382
<BOS> There , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .    38.5251
<BOS> She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when .    47.3688
<BOS> He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in <UNK> , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do .    75.6517
<BOS> Bennet . " - - My mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received <UNK> at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the <UNK> <UNK> Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose <UNK> and <UNK> has preferred me to the valuable <UNK> of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to <UNK> myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those <UNK> and <UNK> which are <UNK> by the <UNK> of England .    247.0979
<BOS> " As soon as ever Mr . Bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs .    13.3601
<BOS> " Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs .    291.4699
<BOS> If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh .    34.5477
<BOS> At such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their <UNK> she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr . Darcy <UNK> to all the <UNK> and <UNK> civility of her husband .    135.5580
<BOS> And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the North .    46.0677
<BOS> Sir William did not say much .    19.4642
<BOS> Here again I shall give you pain - - to what degree you only can tell .    139.0281
<BOS> Philips first brought her the news . ) " Well , so much the better .    99.7795
<BOS> Heaven and <UNK> ! - - of what are you thinking ?    131.8463
<BOS> It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy .    177.6299
<BOS> It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner .    51.9828
<BOS> I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice .    152.0604
<BOS> She looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by <UNK> .    33.3049
<BOS> Did he know of their intending to go off ?    94.4596
<BOS> Oh ! why is not every body as happy ? " Elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express .    112.8891
<BOS> Mr . Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction .    85.1315
<BOS> She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over <UNK> evils , or <UNK> them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition .    209.9641
<BOS> I thought I should have died .    51.1606
<BOS> What will you think of my vanity ?    29.1299
<BOS> Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place .    171.5840
<BOS> It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage .    82.1377
<BOS> " My dear , dear Lydia ! " she cried : " This is delightful indeed ! - - She will be married ! - - I shall see her again ! - - She will be married at sixteen ! - - My good , kind brother ! - - I knew how it would be - - I knew he would manage every thing .    29.9163
<BOS> Hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out . " Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr . Darcy , she left Elizabeth to walk by herself .    76.1929
<BOS> The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances .    351.2671
<BOS> I mend <UNK> remarkably well . " " Thank you - - but I always mend my own . " " How can you <UNK> to write so even ? " He was silent .    83.6151
<BOS> To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little <UNK> was open .    235.2724
<BOS> " The first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them .    21.3882
<BOS> To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an <UNK> to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed .    88.4651
<BOS> Forster and me are such friends ! ) and so she asked the two <UNK> to come , but <UNK> was ill , and so <UNK> was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ?    198.7906
<BOS> Long , " said Miss Lucas , " but I wish he had danced with Eliza . " " Another time , Lizzy , " said her mother , " I would not dance with him , if I were you . " " I believe , Ma ' am , I may safely promise you never to dance with him . " " His pride , " said Miss Lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .    27.7168
<BOS> She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter .    93.9268
<BOS> In this <UNK> state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and <UNK> herself so far as to <UNK> the meaning of every sentence .    124.7898
<BOS> The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had <UNK> engaged their attention .    145.2899
<BOS> Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to <UNK> .    160.0182
<BOS> In a short time , I shall have a daughter married .    23.8237
<BOS> Mr . Bennet accepted the <UNK> , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements .    192.0342
<BOS> And even Mary could assure her family that she had no <UNK> for it .    69.8269
<BOS> He delighted in going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .    89.3397
<BOS> When Mrs .    8.8187
<BOS> Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete <UNK> over him , continued her triumph .    194.5571
<BOS> You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . " They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good - humoured smile , " Come , Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .    36.5844
<BOS> At present we have nothing to guide us .    72.6545
<BOS> He saw Wickham , and afterwards <UNK> on seeing Lydia .    143.3424
<BOS> And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses .    72.3794
<BOS> But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it .    17.0119
<BOS> I have a high respect for your nerves .    60.6744
<BOS> She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .    92.0124
<BOS> " They will join me early to - morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , - - Mr . Bingley and his sisters . " Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow .    49.2406
<BOS> My feelings are not <UNK> about with every attempt to move them .    172.8692
<BOS> Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation .    59.5686
<BOS> He could number the <UNK> in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant <UNK> .    183.1886
<BOS> " From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners <UNK> me with the <UNK> belief of your <UNK> , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground - work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . " " You have said quite enough , madam .    127.6008
<BOS> There was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such <UNK> sisters , home could not be <UNK> , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake .    164.2773
<BOS> Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs .    21.4961
<BOS> He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest <UNK> ; his <UNK> contracted , his air <UNK> .    200.3578
<BOS> He <UNK> how far Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an <UNK> manner how long Mr . Darcy had been staying there .    116.5513
<BOS> The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits .    92.4851
<BOS> Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .    109.4189
<BOS> Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet .    52.1641
<BOS> After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer .    66.6939
<BOS> Yes , I call it a very easy distance . " " I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried Elizabeth .    33.4459
<BOS> " My dear <UNK> , " If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of <UNK> each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s tête - à - tête between two women can never end without a quarrel .    107.3272
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street .    50.3260
<BOS> " Oh , yes ! - - he was to come there with Wickham , you know .    16.1596
<BOS> In that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to Mrs .    45.3188
<BOS> There could not <UNK> in the world two men , over whom Mr . Darcy could have such <UNK> influence .    132.0043
<BOS> At length however Mrs .    25.7008
<BOS> The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty - seven , was Elizabeth ' s intimate friend .    76.5153
<BOS> You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner .    41.4365
<BOS> I cannot forget the follies and <UNK> of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself .    126.7652
<BOS> Mr . Wickham began to speak on more general <UNK> , Meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry .    174.4302
<BOS> I must beg to return to the house . " And she rose as she spoke .    38.6210
<BOS> When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .    41.1482
<BOS> In the first place , she persisted in <UNK> the whole of the matter ; <UNK> , she was very sure that Mr . Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and <UNK> , that the match might be broken off .    68.9387
<BOS> But , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a <UNK> of Jane .    39.9389
<BOS> I am perfectly satisfied .    17.2722
<BOS> Oh , brother , how kind you are ! I know you will <UNK> it all . " But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters .    69.1469
<BOS> " And this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious <UNK> ! of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! " In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose .    98.9066
<BOS> He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion .    81.6511
<BOS> She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ' s height , or rather <UNK> . " " How I long to see her again ! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much .    85.5602
<BOS> What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?    144.7018
<BOS> It would be dreadful ! She blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk .    71.2710
<BOS> If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better .    24.2954
<BOS> But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and that in the eye of a servant <UNK> every virtue . " Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in <UNK> of his behaviour to Wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different <UNK> ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor Wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire .    79.0039
<BOS> Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be <UNK> .    120.8047
<BOS> As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence .    207.0293
<BOS> The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , <UNK> Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike .    138.4778
<BOS> She wanted to talk , but there seemed an <UNK> on every subject .    51.9135
<BOS> She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations .    71.1902
<BOS> And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ?    113.3874
<BOS> " How strange this is ! And for this we are to be thankful .    49.9911
<BOS> But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . " " That is the most unforgiving speech , " said Elizabeth , " that I ever heard you utter .    48.7609
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . " " Let me write for you , " said Jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself . " " I dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . " And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house .    29.1040
<BOS> " He only told me , what I have now told you . " Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart <UNK> with indignation .    42.3980
<BOS> Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her <UNK> and <UNK> , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart <UNK> a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement .    133.1728
<BOS> Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Mr . Wickham and herself .    23.1914
<BOS> Miss Darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving <UNK> , readily obeyed .    161.6304
<BOS> It cannot be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account .    66.6134
<BOS> " I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said Lady Catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not <UNK> a great deal . " " I assure you , Madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice .    24.3178
<BOS> She was engaged one day as she walked , in re - <UNK> Jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her .    79.6886
<BOS> Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline <UNK> <UNK> of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to <UNK> the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter .    240.7190
<BOS> It is impossible that he should still love me . " After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on <UNK> their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - <UNK> , there <UNK> to be a little alteration .    139.2328
<BOS> When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .    86.5276
<BOS> If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough .    58.2157
<BOS> We have heard nothing from town . " " Dear madam , " cried Mrs .    21.7864
<BOS> She not <UNK> stopped at the Parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out .    96.0569
<BOS> " I know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , - - and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five <UNK> any object .    62.3381
<BOS> Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs .    120.1917
<BOS> As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs .    100.9848
<BOS> However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the <UNK> property of some one or other of their daughters .    150.8171
<BOS> Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial .    62.3279
<BOS> But Jane was to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation .    35.2238
<BOS> Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! " " She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this <UNK> .    114.8708
<BOS> The whole family in short were properly <UNK> on the occasion .    131.4067
<BOS> Your <UNK> makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a <UNK> . " " Poor Wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his manner . " " There certainly was some great <UNK> in the education of those two young men .    130.9815
<BOS> Gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt , that Pemberley was situated .    93.0560
<BOS> Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , <UNK> , manner of talking to her brother .    122.5983
<BOS> " There is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said Kitty ; " who can it be ? " " Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . " " La ! " replied Kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before .    30.4229
<BOS> Poor dear child ! And now here ' s Mr . Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ?    85.6293
<BOS> But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs .    16.9187
<BOS> His character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . Darcy ' s sister , as , by Wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away .    56.9909
<BOS> Is her husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ?    42.9649
<BOS> <UNK> as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the <UNK> of an intercourse renewed after many years <UNK> .    90.6557
<BOS> We were always encouraged to read , and had all the <UNK> that were necessary .    102.8752
<BOS> With such <UNK> for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the officers , Mr . Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs .    96.7624
<BOS> <UNK> are too much like <UNK> .    474.2950
<BOS> " How <UNK> we are <UNK> in ! " cried Lydia .    117.2314
<BOS> It appeared to her merely the <UNK> of Caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or <UNK> spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one .    197.0492
<BOS> Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill .    64.2467
<BOS> Her ladyship ' s carriage is <UNK> ordered for us .    121.7917
<BOS> Thank God ! I have not that pain .    113.2403
<BOS> " I confess , " said he , " that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ' s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings .    28.9141
<BOS> While these <UNK> - born notions were passing in their <UNK> , the perturbation of Elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing .    355.9950
<BOS> Did she call to refuse her consent ? " To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it .    106.2354
<BOS> He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds .    87.7337
<BOS> Mr . Collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair .    75.9817
<BOS> As the day of his arrival drew near , " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister .    34.9146
<BOS> Lydia - - the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon <UNK> up every private care ; and covering her face with her <UNK> , Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern .    113.2189
<BOS> You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . " " I am exceedingly gratified , " said Bingley , " by your <UNK> what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .    61.3704
<BOS> Not one party , or scheme , or any thing .    56.5524
<BOS> And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart .    53.5632
<BOS> Mr . Collins ' s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs .    25.9393
<BOS> On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .    44.2729
<BOS> I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior .    95.9749
<BOS> Mr . Darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her .    30.1766
<BOS> In confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the <UNK> transactions in which they had been connected , without actually <UNK> her authority , but stating it to be such as might be <UNK> on .    111.3011
<BOS> Their situation was awkward enough ; but her ' s she thought was still worse .    68.0987
<BOS> I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . " Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of <UNK> <UNK> , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London .    46.3666
<BOS> The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the <UNK> of the first .    118.1128
<BOS> At least , you should not remind your <UNK> of inviting him . " " As I did the other day , " said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that .    78.9035
<BOS> You will not find him more <UNK> spoken of by any one . " " I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be <UNK> beyond their deserts ; but with him I believe it does not often happen .    62.2836
<BOS> They had long wished to see him .    26.9662
<BOS> That he is as false and deceitful , as he is <UNK> . " " And do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs .    32.6190
<BOS> They <UNK> as expeditiously as possible ; and <UNK> one night on the road , reached Longbourn by dinner - time the next day .    264.6024
<BOS> He is come - - Mr . Bingley is come . - - He is , indeed .    25.2845
<BOS> It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .    54.6245
<BOS> This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .    68.8246
<BOS> While there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for ever .    80.2462
<BOS> Long .    23.4770
<BOS> Though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour .    108.1409
<BOS> But every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render Mr . Darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely <UNK> <UNK> the whole .    163.9428
<BOS> " You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . " This was invitation enough .    32.6585
<BOS> Have you never happened to see her there ? " She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any <UNK> of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet .    45.9070
<BOS> Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected .    38.1240
<BOS> Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate .    151.5391
<BOS> Bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from London , <UNK> he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .    72.9117
<BOS> In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , with occasional <UNK> in praise of his own humble abode , and the <UNK> it was receiving , he was happily employed <UNK> the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs .    126.0192
<BOS> " Well , Lizzy , " said Mrs .    4.0620
<BOS> Long and the <UNK> soon .    263.4644
<BOS> The only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter .    68.0362
<BOS> The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield .    54.5488
<BOS> She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself .    95.7407
<BOS> I expected to find a more reasonable young woman .    48.1364
<BOS> But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill - judged a direction of talents ; talents which <UNK> used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of <UNK> the mind of his wife .    197.5947
<BOS> The subject was <UNK> no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .    62.5120
<BOS> After <UNK> his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many <UNK> expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , <UNK> he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an <UNK> argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest    109.6818
of men .    59.5574
<BOS> They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from <UNK> to the library ; - - their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the <UNK> , who said , " If you are looking for my master , <UNK> ' am , he is walking towards the little copse . " Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock .    87.6291
<BOS> Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ?    42.6556
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> Mr . Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs .    33.1107
<BOS> She saw all the <UNK> of the camp ; its <UNK> <UNK> forth in <UNK> <UNK> of lines , crowded with the young and the <UNK> , and <UNK> with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> with at least six officers at once .    700.6558
<BOS> His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile .    50.6185
<BOS> Their manners are not equal to his . " " Certainly not ; at first .    45.9160
<BOS> In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach .    98.5761
<BOS> Who are your uncles and <UNK> ?    355.8402
<BOS> One morning , about a week after Bingley ' s engagement with Jane had been formed , as he and the <UNK> of the family were sitting together in the dining - room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn .    56.6836
<BOS> They will take care not to <UNK> their income .    107.6854
<BOS> Bennet was <UNK> the fire .    202.6316
<BOS> <UNK> much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women .    180.7804
<BOS> Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . " Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment .    74.2451
<BOS> They owed the restoration of Lydia , her character , every thing to him .    44.7866
<BOS> Upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward .    131.0251
<BOS> Elizabeth felt Jane ' s pleasure .    39.9468
<BOS> " Can you come to - morrow ? " Yes , he had no engagement at all for to - morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity .    37.9293
<BOS> But enough of this .    53.5713
<BOS> She studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different .    306.9256
<BOS> These parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not .    161.3947
<BOS> My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other .    80.2717
<BOS> It was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .    47.9814
<BOS> But of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .    115.5929
<BOS> After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt .    108.5346
<BOS> Their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush .    101.7986
<BOS> Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .    82.8088
<BOS> Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least .    79.9279
<BOS> Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her <UNK> and <UNK> , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with Miss Bennet .    230.4224
<BOS> Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by the bye , Mrs .    41.5151
<BOS> " There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , - - Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? " The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she <UNK> to it .    59.9277
<BOS> How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ' s debts have been , " said Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not <UNK> of his own .    48.1696
<BOS> Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known Sir William ' s too long .    75.4514
<BOS> " You were Mr . Bingley ' s first choice . " " Yes ; - - but he seemed to like his second better . " " Oh ! - - you mean Jane , I suppose - - because he danced with her twice .    22.6272
<BOS> " Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried Colonel Fitzwilliam .    30.1798
<BOS> <UNK> more than half a day ' s journey .    64.2757
<BOS> The time fixed for the beginning of their <UNK> tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Mrs .    118.2064
<BOS> So imprudent a match on both sides ! - - But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood .    86.2608
<BOS> As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <UNK> them more .    80.7204
<BOS> To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the <UNK> of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .    135.4698
<BOS> There is a <UNK> about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others .    83.9307
<BOS> Come be quick , be quick ! where is your <UNK> my dear ? " But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters .    104.2073
<BOS> People do not die of little trifling <UNK> .    280.6496
<BOS> I do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . " The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr . Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him .    55.5227
<BOS> The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday .    63.7317
<BOS> The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an <UNK> of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of .    113.6735
<BOS> " How could you begin ? " said she .    17.1000
<BOS> She continued in very <UNK> reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room .    66.7846
<BOS> It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance .    71.8336
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> On being made acquainted with the present Mr . Darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a <UNK> , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Mr . Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy .    101.1042
<BOS> But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard <UNK> that Mrs .    65.7567
<BOS> * * * * * Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother .    20.1105
<BOS> I hope they will not meet at all .    20.0633
<BOS> It cannot last long .    91.1314
<BOS> After watching her a little , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so <UNK> .    224.1637
<BOS> With many compliments to them , and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , - - to an audience not merely <UNK> , but incredulous ; for Mrs .    149.0705
<BOS> I speak nothing but the truth .    52.2134
<BOS> My father and mother believe the worst , but I cannot think so ill of him .    29.9472
<BOS> It has often led him to be liberal and generous , - - to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his <UNK> , and <UNK> the poor .    189.8657
<BOS> With no expectation of pleasure , but with the <UNK> curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two <UNK> of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . - - The envelope itself was likewise full . - - <UNK> her way along the lane , she then began it .    267.3936
<BOS> who attended to you ?    236.6844
<BOS> " When I consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that I might have prevented it ! - - I who knew what he was .    45.7920
<BOS> " If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of <UNK> <UNK> before he <UNK> . " In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' <UNK> , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick <UNK> , <UNK> over <UNK> and springing over <UNK> with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty <UNK> , and a face <UNK> with the warmth of exercise .    254.4817
<BOS> Gardiner , " I begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion .    17.7159
<BOS> Mr . Gardiner declared his willingness , and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .    30.1044
<BOS> Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to <UNK> the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present .    82.9205
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without <UNK> and <UNK> , for she really did know where her friend was to be found .    104.2546
<BOS> Jane ' s temper was not <UNK> , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .    111.6990
<BOS> Yet he knew to the contrary himself .    108.6240
<BOS> what is it about ?    81.7701
<BOS> Such was Miss Lucas ' s scheme ; and <UNK> were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon .    117.8645
<BOS> The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane ; and till the morrow , their going was <UNK> .    123.8789
<BOS> Every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed <UNK> away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and <UNK> would come in time .    133.1517
<BOS> Bennet was quite disconcerted .    27.1394
<BOS> On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor .    63.9281
<BOS> I am very glad you liked her .    16.3184
<BOS> She began at length to recover , to <UNK> about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself .    139.9184
<BOS> She remembered that he had <UNK> of having no fear of seeing Mr . Darcy - - that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had <UNK> the Netherfield ball the very next week .    64.3425
<BOS> This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem .    48.9307
<BOS> She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of <UNK> , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than <UNK> anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .    147.5666
<BOS> Mr . Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr . Bingley .    33.8887
<BOS> I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning .    55.9276
<BOS> Wickham is safe . " " And Mary King is safe ! " added Elizabeth ; " safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . " " She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . " " But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said Jane .    52.4570
<BOS> I always had a value for him .    45.9442
<BOS> Mr . Denny and Mr . Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr . Philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs .    48.1451
<BOS> Mr . Jones says we must not think of moving her .    85.9792
<BOS> To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . - - I cannot blame myself for having done thus much .    83.1566
<BOS> Its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs .    112.2922
<BOS> <UNK> since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it .    94.9660
<BOS> She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found . - - Elizabeth could but just affect concern in <UNK> him ; she really rejoiced at it .    75.0178
<BOS> She will make him a very proper wife . " Mr . Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and Sir William , to Elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the <UNK> , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly <UNK> whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way .    77.0946
<BOS> It was first broken by Mrs .    27.8272
<BOS> It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of <UNK> in that way .    82.8962
<BOS> The comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression .    82.1392
<BOS> There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us .    92.6183
<BOS> As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no <UNK> from the marriage of her sisters .    132.1114
<BOS> Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; - - she knew not how to believe that Mr . Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr . Bingley ' s regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . - - The possibility of his having really endured such <UNK> , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained .    66.8958
<BOS> " And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " I hope not . " " It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . " " May I ask to what these questions <UNK> ? " " <UNK> to the <UNK> of your character , " said she , endeavouring to <UNK> off her gravity .    104.3962
<BOS> The <UNK> wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a <UNK> county to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .    92.4123
<BOS> Bennet , having <UNK> about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the <UNK> , than she entered the breakfast - room , and <UNK> both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection .    208.1121
<BOS> But she is nothing to me now .    21.3988
<BOS> She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal .    232.9508
<BOS> Not all that Mrs .    18.3109
<BOS> He was fond of the country and of books ; and from these <UNK> had arisen his principal <UNK> .    191.0323
<BOS> But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary <UNK> of belief .    107.3859
<BOS> Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .    117.7542
<BOS> One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then <UNK> on something <UNK> . " " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . " " Indeed I could not .    92.6281
<BOS> Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself .    42.1503
<BOS> He even looked at her with a smile of affected <UNK> .    109.1509
<BOS> When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister - in - law of the card - table - - but in vain .    53.5069
<BOS> It was to this effect : " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you - - be assured that we are all well .    100.4549
<BOS> You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say .    41.6163
<BOS> The evening passed quietly , <UNK> by any thing extraordinary .    110.4058
<BOS> Lydia ' s <UNK> first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars .    55.2133
<BOS> Mr . Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many .    109.8068
<BOS> He <UNK> it himself without disguise . " " No " - - said Darcy , " I have made no such <UNK> .    95.8572
<BOS> I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude .    69.4638
<BOS> " When you have killed all your own birds , Mr . Bingley , " said her mother , " I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Mr . Bennet ' s manor .    35.2172
<BOS> Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which <UNK> it all .    358.1234
<BOS> The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . " " Certainly , " replied Elizabeth - - " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .    93.8329
<BOS> Her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " There are very few people of whom so much can be said .    92.4726
<BOS> Did you see it ? " Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations .    34.9187
<BOS> But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her .    38.0309
<BOS> And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .    100.9926
<BOS> She comes to us to - day .    25.8585
<BOS> Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . " " I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied Elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it . - - I must be in town next Saturday . " " Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks .    22.4693
<BOS> Mrs .    4.3363
<BOS> But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . " Mrs .    28.1629
<BOS> I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen .    66.2722
<BOS> But no such recollection <UNK> her .    539.9926
<BOS> You are lucky in having such a master . " " Yes , Sir , I know I am .    30.0254
<BOS> Her ease and good spirits increased .    124.1626
<BOS> This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his <UNK> , but Mrs .    83.1062
<BOS> I shall be back by dinner . " " I admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed Mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . " " We will go as far as Meryton with you , " said Catherine and Lydia . - - Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together .    54.7973
<BOS> My faults , according to this <UNK> , are heavy indeed ! But perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my <UNK> confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design .    193.2351
<BOS> He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour <UNK> .    70.9145
<BOS> Oh ! here comes Hill .    279.6340
<BOS> Does your charge give you much trouble ?    123.1903
<BOS> But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object .    36.5552
<BOS> He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else .    30.5483
<BOS> Hurst were going out .    90.9247
<BOS> " He seems to be a most <UNK> and polite young man , upon my word ; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so <UNK> as to let him come to us again . " " There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . " " Though it is difficult , " said Jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . " Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference    84.3699
for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of <UNK> , marrying , and <UNK> his <UNK> whenever it were required .    299.6353
<BOS> After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . " " What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ?    61.4401
<BOS> Every thing <UNK> what is strong already .    316.3907
<BOS> Bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr . Bingley ' s continued absence .    49.0123
<BOS> For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " " Oh ! " cried Elizabeth , " I am excessively diverted .    52.4227
<BOS> It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever .    70.8445
<BOS> She would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .    100.3475
<BOS> Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr . Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with an apology for <UNK> him also with Lizzy .    111.2203
<BOS> " And that , " said Mrs .    9.1025
<BOS> I shall see her in <UNK> .    71.6711
<BOS> But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill . " Lydia declared herself satisfied .    66.4395
<BOS> Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body .    51.4948
<BOS> We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton .    63.8038
<BOS> His apparent partiality had <UNK> , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else .    173.9115
<BOS> Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to <UNK> him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to <UNK> his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London .    95.3651
<BOS> Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied .    48.6167
<BOS> And it was settled that we should all be there by <UNK> o ' clock .    86.0994
<BOS> I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy .    63.5728
<BOS> More thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed .    326.0686
<BOS> His attachment to Rosings , certainly <UNK> . " Mr . Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter .    108.1521
<BOS> Gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .    68.4684
<BOS> I dare say Mr . Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . " " I desire you will do no such thing .    49.6820
<BOS> These were the contents : " MY DEAR <UNK> , " You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as I am missed .    80.3997
<BOS> It is <UNK> ! in every view it is <UNK> ! " " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these .    88.7916
<BOS> " Oh ! yes - - it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely <UNK> <UNK> would be at Meryton again .    98.2478
<BOS> <UNK> , stay , I will go myself .    93.7414
<BOS> The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow .    137.9363
<BOS> It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the <UNK> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours .    112.2601
<BOS> My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it .    89.2343
<BOS> This was one point , with regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr . Bennet could have no hesitation in <UNK> to the proposal before him .    50.2737
<BOS> It is very often nothing but our own vanity that <UNK> us .    157.9965
<BOS> It was all conjecture . " " What is it you mean ? " " It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing . " " You may depend upon my not mentioning it . " " And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley .    40.4168
<BOS> This was agreed to , and Mrs .    22.1905
<BOS> I wish you had been there .    24.4358
<BOS> " Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer .    32.3416
<BOS> I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge .    63.6937
<BOS> The day of his and Lydia ' s departure soon came , and Mrs .    36.0282
<BOS> Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much <UNK> her affection for the other .    143.8103
<BOS> I write without any intention of <UNK> you , or <UNK> myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the <UNK> , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .    155.8680
<BOS> He bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his <UNK> to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr . Darcy , with an expression of half - laughing alarm .    84.2270
<BOS> Bennet , " to walk to <UNK> Mount this morning .    198.7855
<BOS> Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . " The wedding took place ; the bride and <UNK> set off for Kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual .    71.3789
<BOS> They were able to love each other , even as well as they intended .    32.6358
<BOS> People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking .    464.6323
<BOS> Bennet , " you will wait on him of course . " " No , no .    23.8425
<BOS> The sudden <UNK> of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now <UNK> himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear - <UNK> perhaps in his case than in Charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence .    118.4268
<BOS> March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .    130.9285
<BOS> The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .    97.3483
<BOS> The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr . Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball .    107.8271
<BOS> They could not be <UNK> by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have <UNK> it for Mr . Darcy .    60.6024
<BOS> We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . " She was then proceeding to all the particulars of <UNK> , muslin , and <UNK> , and would shortly have <UNK> some very <UNK> orders , had not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted .    134.5406
<BOS> Let me mend it for you .    37.5585
<BOS> Every body is disgusted with his pride .    47.9076
<BOS> I know we dine with four and twenty families . " Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could <UNK> Bingley to keep his countenance .    204.4363
<BOS> ' Ah ! Mrs .    119.3067
<BOS> She was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet .    24.2341
<BOS> However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham .    57.4896
<BOS> My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room .    67.5509
<BOS> He meant to <UNK> his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it .    104.1489
<BOS> Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved .    189.1203
<BOS> He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even <UNK> included him in her invitation for the next evening , <UNK> <UNK> unknown to her before .    103.2195
<BOS> Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to <UNK> her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .    105.1823
<BOS> When the first transports of <UNK> which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former <UNK> .    252.4824
<BOS> Bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband .    53.2368
<BOS> He was <UNK> for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have <UNK> it .    76.3837
<BOS> His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill - judged <UNK> of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter .    178.7457
<BOS> I am perfectly serious in my refusal . - - You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so . - - Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . " " Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , " said Mr . Collins very gravely - - " but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all <UNK> of you .    45.5997
<BOS> Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her <UNK> such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with .    58.9972
<BOS> I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . " " Miss Bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that I am not to be <UNK> with .    28.1278
<BOS> Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs .    31.5317
<BOS> He had <UNK> for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how <UNK> an evil he might have <UNK> .    180.7488
<BOS> I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent .    84.3996
<BOS> she was dying to know what could be his meaning " - - and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ?    109.2937
<BOS> " There is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not <UNK> .    37.8565
<BOS> " Your friend <UNK> delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; - - " and I doubt not that you are an <UNK> in the <UNK> yourself , Mr . Darcy . " " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " " Yes , indeed , and received no <UNK> pleasure from the sight .    89.7602
<BOS> Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening .    125.0320
<BOS> The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a <UNK> from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a <UNK> voice , " Are you pleased with Kent ? " A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and <UNK> - - and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk .    119.0604
<BOS> I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . " Mrs .    38.3559
<BOS> " Not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our <UNK> way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . " Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr . Darcy in any thing , and <UNK> therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives .    76.3658
<BOS> I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .    72.0679
<BOS> There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste .    101.3217
<BOS> It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice - - a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself .    100.4229
<BOS> In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage .    69.6427
<BOS> Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head .    97.4149
<BOS> Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano - forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly <UNK> , she seated herself .    174.9684
<BOS> You have employed your time much better .    92.5252
<BOS> That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr . Darcy ! that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection .    65.3705
<BOS> It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs .    55.8191
<BOS> Mr . what ' s his name .    113.3192
<BOS> Yet , indeed , I am in earnest .    66.9236
<BOS> She was ashamed to think how much .    33.2273
<BOS> Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , <UNK> against the <UNK> conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own <UNK> and ill <UNK> ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing .    323.6268
<BOS> His <UNK> to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking .    90.6073
<BOS> The housekeeper came ; a respectable - looking , <UNK> woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .    97.4523
<BOS> We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home .    132.2773
<BOS> But really , Ma ' am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . - - The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first .    94.0340
<BOS> My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .    29.6336
<BOS> The dear colonel <UNK> his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year .    392.0918
<BOS> Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . " " To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart .    60.0695
<BOS> But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present .    45.3360
<BOS> On finding Mrs .    46.0200
<BOS> The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a <UNK> of Mrs .    71.6939
<BOS> Mr . Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to <UNK> himself on one of the <UNK> and go to sleep .    89.7539
<BOS> Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . " " If you believed it impossible to be true , " said Elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far .    47.6551
<BOS> has she any family ? " " She has one only daughter , the <UNK> of Rosings , and of very extensive property . " " Ah ! " cried Mrs .    62.8769
<BOS> Darcy may be guessed .    88.5566
<BOS> You must allow me to tell you how <UNK> I admire and love you . " Elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression .    60.6950
<BOS> Lydia was a <UNK> , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age .    116.7532
<BOS> Mr . Darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a <UNK> sense of her sister ' s <UNK> .    80.7196
<BOS> A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern .    68.6988
<BOS> They were to be off as soon as possible .    14.8328
<BOS> The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification .    110.6055
<BOS> They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited .    88.1840
<BOS> But what is that to me ?    30.7824
<BOS> Elizabeth longed to <UNK> its <UNK> ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs .    98.0362
<BOS> Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . " Mr . Bennet made no answer .    18.7580
<BOS> To Caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit .    57.9767
<BOS> I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - <UNK> , as I always am .    71.2749
<BOS> To be sure , you knew no actual good of me - - but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love . " " Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? " " <UNK> Jane ! who could have done less for her ?    90.0484
<BOS> Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his <UNK> ; and she could not help fancying that in <UNK> the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .    69.5562
<BOS> Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? " " For the liveliness of your mind , I did . " " You may as well call it impertinence at once .    81.2201
<BOS> Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such <UNK> as these , what would have been her sensations ?    217.9621
<BOS> Elizabeth went away with her head full of him .    49.1918
<BOS> " It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before .    23.8656
<BOS> About ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire , to which he belonged .    70.8311
<BOS> I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point .    65.7392
<BOS> When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe .    77.0630
<BOS> She was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and <UNK> temper .    183.3923
<BOS> But , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt .    51.7777
<BOS> The united <UNK> of his two unfeeling sisters and of his <UNK> friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment .    144.4740
<BOS> I believe I have now told you every thing .    28.3504
<BOS> The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her <UNK> of Mrs .    76.2164
<BOS> But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely <UNK> for Mr . Darcy ' s pleasure in the Bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr . Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , " I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . " This part of his intelligence , though <UNK>    84.0656
by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . - - <UNK> , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was <UNK> to Wickham .    170.9826
<BOS> She certainly did not hate him .    30.2957
<BOS> You know I always speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves .    92.4314
<BOS> Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , ( glancing at her sister and Bingley , ) shall take place .    94.5971
<BOS> <UNK> the most violent against him was Mrs .    226.2805
<BOS> I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . - - That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; - - but his regard did not appear to me enough <UNK> for him to see her without some danger . - - Perhaps this <UNK> , this disguise , was beneath me . - - It is done , however , and it was done for the best . - - On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer .    64.1971
<BOS> A house in town ! Every thing that is charming ! <UNK> daughters married ! Ten thousand a year ! Oh , Lord ! What will become of me .    86.3140
<BOS> You must not suspect me .    32.1917
<BOS> She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her <UNK> , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . " " She had better have <UNK> at home , " cried Elizabeth ; " perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours .    81.9582
<BOS> " I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s <UNK> in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself .    63.2375
<BOS> " I see your design , Bingley , " said his friend . - - " You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . " " Perhaps I do .    42.9075
<BOS> Lydia was exceedingly fond of him .    22.6736
<BOS> Let us hope for better things .    88.1448
<BOS> But on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away .    37.4822
<BOS> Society has claims on us all ; and I <UNK> myself one of those who consider intervals of <UNK> and amusement as desirable for every body . " Elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak <UNK> to Mr . Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr . Bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from <UNK> a <UNK> either from the <UNK> , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by    85.7101
<UNK> to dance .    67.5090
<BOS> I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . " " Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said Darcy , " has too much truth .    55.5487
<BOS> Mr . Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr . Wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .    69.4882
<BOS> To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add .    160.9383
<BOS> Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? " She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed .    102.7136
<BOS> I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . " Not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs .    29.8223
<BOS> He now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they <UNK> with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr . Darcy .    111.9935
<BOS> Sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion .    260.5690
<BOS> They went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her .    26.4462
<BOS> He <UNK> imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world .    238.2771
<BOS> She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . - - Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , <UNK> , absurd .    114.0309
<BOS> They were natural and just .    156.0510
<BOS> Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way .    102.9692
<BOS> Their first subject was the <UNK> of the Rosings party . - - " I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , " said Lady Catherine ; " I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do .    42.5351
<BOS> He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over . - - To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed .    65.7866
<BOS> Their society can afford no pleasure , that will <UNK> for such wretchedness as this ! Let me never see either one or the other again ! " Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no <UNK> , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re - <UNK> the admiration of her former lover .    219.9853
<BOS> We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve .    53.8493
<BOS> The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .    25.2197
<BOS> Their table was <UNK> stupid .    652.4076
<BOS> He was very fond of them . " This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr . Wickham ' s being among them .    25.9507
<BOS> Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her .    81.1158
<BOS> As for your Elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what <UNK> could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " " It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and <UNK> , and the eye - <UNK> , so remarkably fine , might be <UNK> . " At that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs .    120.7656
<BOS> Where shall you change horses ? - - Oh ! <UNK> , of course . - - If you mention my name at the <UNK> , you will be attended to . " Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was .    85.4495
<BOS> <UNK> the bell , Kitty , for Hill .    183.0774
<BOS> " Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? " " Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . " " <UNK> , " thought Elizabeth , " when she <UNK> to Ramsgate . " " If your master would marry , you might see more of him . " " Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when that will be .    40.4667
<BOS> " He is indeed - - but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? " Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away .    58.2422
<BOS> The tête - à - tête surprised them .    88.8053
<BOS> When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away .    50.3744
<BOS> Gardiner , who was not a great <UNK> , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .    57.7991
<BOS> What are you telling Miss Bennet ?    58.1054
<BOS> When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; and Miss De Bourgh <UNK> herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both .    91.8992
<BOS> What a good joke it will be ! I can hardly write for laughing .    97.1100
<BOS> On entering the room , he seemed to <UNK> ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided .    75.8933
<BOS> Your sweetness and <UNK> are really <UNK> ; I do not know what to say to you .    94.7624
<BOS> " But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded .    47.3643
<BOS> Gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : " I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , <UNK> of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write .    85.6507
<BOS> On the following Monday , Mrs .    28.6581
<BOS> " I never heard any thing so abominable .    30.9024
<BOS> You must <UNK> to send somebody .    267.3840
<BOS> Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of <UNK> . " " My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . " " Has your governess left you ? " " We never had any governess . " " No governess ! How was that possible ?    76.8304
<BOS> My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her .    43.3953
<BOS> That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head .    123.4926
<BOS> He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . " Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .    47.5881
<BOS> It is really too great a violation of <UNK> , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it .    72.6354
<BOS> She had ventured only one glance at Darcy .    107.8077
<BOS> She is almost three and twenty ! Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty ! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you can ' t think .    137.6693
<BOS> <UNK> my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey .    80.4424
<BOS> <UNK> it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it .    92.5034
<BOS> " Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? " said she .    34.8873
<BOS> I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of <UNK> your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , - - but of this hereafter .    98.4115
<BOS> Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . " But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer .    43.4570
<BOS> " I should never have said Mrs .    18.4608
<BOS> She is a great <UNK> and has no pleasure in anything else . " " I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am not a great <UNK> , and I have pleasure in many things . " " In <UNK> your sister I am sure you have pleasure , " said Bingley ; " and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . " Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were <UNK> .    60.7831
<BOS> Miss Bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . Darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page .    77.0830
<BOS> She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter .    38.4972
<BOS> But now it was all too natural .    42.0632
<BOS> Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to Brighton .    71.6961
<BOS> Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to <UNK> bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about .    135.0510
<BOS> He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant .    54.4116
<BOS> The rest of the evening brought her little amusement .    41.0702
<BOS> He has more to give .    34.1820
<BOS> When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs .    23.9140
<BOS> Hurst thought the same , and added , " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent <UNK> .    61.6353
<BOS> To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , <UNK> that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her .    52.8072
<BOS> After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss Bingley ' s voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family .    45.8233
<BOS> " When my eyes were opened to his real character . - - Oh ! had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do ! But I knew not - - I was afraid of doing too much .    53.2156
<BOS> Allowing for the common <UNK> of the game , Mr . Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr . Darcy .    45.4126
<BOS> Good bye .    43.3960
<BOS> Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not <UNK> them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see Mr . Jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards Mr . Collins by Jane ' s introduction of him .    70.0219
<BOS> He was most highly esteemed by Mr . Darcy , a most intimate , <UNK> friend .    78.0341
<BOS> Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .    79.3730
<BOS> She examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or <UNK> the <UNK> in <UNK> ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs .    131.9164
<BOS> Nothing could console and nothing <UNK> her . - - Nor did that day <UNK> out her resentment .    604.9819
<BOS> Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare .    155.6414
<BOS> No ; <UNK> had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .    142.4684
<BOS> You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it .    62.5212
<BOS> <UNK> Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead .    50.5931
<BOS> " I am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ?    28.9920
<BOS> She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr . Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it .    45.8571
<BOS> " If he wants our society , let him seek it .    73.3123
<BOS> If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great <UNK> .    31.9163
<BOS> Philips , the Lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " Mrs .    75.1884
<BOS> They were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the <UNK> of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with <UNK> formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment .    99.3634
<BOS> Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest .    83.2481
<BOS> I can no longer help thanking you for your <UNK> kindness to my poor sister .    73.7118
<BOS> <UNK> away the letter immediately and <UNK> a smile , she said , " I did not know before that you ever walked this way . " " I have been making the tour of the Park , " he replied , " as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage .    83.5095
<BOS> Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr . Darcy they had only seen at church .    45.9754
<BOS> Mr . Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with <UNK> civility that they were perfectly needless .    102.0766
<BOS> Though he had <UNK> with a <UNK> eye more than one <UNK> of perfect <UNK> in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his <UNK> that her manners were not those of the <UNK> world , he was caught by their easy playfulness .    215.0442
<BOS> Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all <UNK> her purpose by his attempt at persuasion .    218.4658
<BOS> Wickham ' s affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it ; not equal to Lydia ' s for him .    39.9305
<BOS> His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , <UNK> at the same time the most <UNK> composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure .    148.1843
<BOS> " How abominable ! - - I wonder that the very pride of this Mr . Darcy has not made him just to you ! - - If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be <UNK> , - - for <UNK> I must call it . " " It is wonderful , " - - replied Wickham , - - " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; - - and pride has often been his best friend .    62.5998
<BOS> Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and <UNK> her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family .    61.5136
<BOS> The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball - - and at this ball , what do you think he did ?    47.1321
<BOS> Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided .    63.8277
<BOS> Besides , it will not much signify what one <UNK> this summer , after the - - - - shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . " " Are they indeed ? " cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .    61.2835
<BOS> Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a <UNK> chaise . " " I do not mind his not talking to Mrs .    91.3365
<BOS> She had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained <UNK> of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening .    85.0214
