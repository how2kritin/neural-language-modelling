Stephen filled again the three cups .    576.2267
Time I used to try <UNK> down on my <UNK> what she said dressing .    1136.8076
Their likes : their breaths , too , sweetened with tea and <UNK> , their <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> .    706.9735

That was in his eyes .    169.0929
The <UNK> shavingbowl <UNK> , forgotten , on the parapet .    525.4512
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again , murmuring here and there a word .    569.1909
Tell about places you have been , strange <UNK> .    999.6144
Talbot <UNK> : Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves , Through the dear might . . .    563.7984

Do you want the blind up ?    469.5657
<UNK> with money and <UNK> .    457.7568
Mulligan said , glancing at her .    204.0543
He would be eleven now if he had lived .    964.9893
Useless : can ’ t move .    309.0323

Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on .    614.1299
It ’ s a <UNK> up , I think .    183.0891
He had reached the open backdoor of All <UNK> .    1171.3182

Not at all , Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk .    463.9805

His eyes open <UNK> in <UNK> stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted .    1244.7013
There ’ s a word I wanted to ask you .    227.3281
Do you know what ?    399.8640
he asked .    124.6581

Another slice of bread and butter : three , four : right .    418.9357

Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money .    993.5854
Tell her : more and more : all .    244.0400
He curled them between his <UNK> at <UNK> and swallowed them softly .    1662.0258
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly : Is this the day for your <UNK> wash , Kinch ?    776.1624
He <UNK> the page with a sheet of <UNK> <UNK> and carried his copybook back to his bench .    851.0419

And do you know why ?    753.4362
There can be no two <UNK> on the matter .    694.1807

He <UNK> , <UNK> , stalked round it , brother , <UNK> <UNK> , went round it , <UNK> <UNK> like a dog all over the dead dog ’ s <UNK> fell .    790.1672
The priest went along by them , murmuring , holding the thing in his hands .    457.2051
He passed Saint Joseph ’ s <UNK> school .    835.3816
He looked at the cattle , blurred in silver heat .    459.8382

He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh .    1181.9689
Then he read the letter again : twice .    366.6695
<UNK> of <UNK> then and now .    358.5693
Sad too .    132.7630

To smell the gentle smoke of tea , <UNK> of the pan , sizzling butter .    465.8069
he cried suddenly .    444.5528
Buck Mulligan said .    143.3093

By them , the man with my voice and my eyes and a <UNK> with ashes on her breath .    444.3383
From farther away , walking <UNK> across from the <UNK> tide , figures , two .    800.0199

<UNK> of all things I am here to read , <UNK> and <UNK> , the nearing tide , that <UNK> <UNK> .    705.7017
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband .    915.2338
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting .    474.7559
He strolled out to the doorway .    225.6306
The porter <UNK> the valise up on the well .    562.4968
<UNK> : and that is the ineluctable modality of the <UNK> .    271.6739

Behind her lord , his helpmate , <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> .    738.8342
I put a mark in it .    266.5917
I am , ma ’ am , Buck Mulligan answered .    324.1768
<UNK> back and pointing , Stephen said with <UNK> : It is a symbol of Irish art .    591.5150
That so ?    731.4521
The tea was drawn .    698.4352
Please tell me what you think of poor me .    432.9067
A <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> with shiny topboots .    2522.9888
<UNK> .    27.7784
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of <UNK> .    910.7692
<UNK> I going to aunt Sara ’ s or not ?    496.5269
Well , <UNK> .    155.6270

In the darkness of the <UNK> they wait , their <UNK> <UNK> , my <UNK> valise , around a board of <UNK> <UNK> .    918.9390
No use <UNK> her .    770.9408
Might work a press pass .    446.3408
Down , up , forward , back .    112.3916
I am trying to work up <UNK> with the <UNK> .    777.7462
Conmee : <UNK> <UNK> knows him : <UNK> .    1480.6447
My <UNK> , Blackwood <UNK> , <UNK> to me it is <UNK> treated and <UNK> in Austria by <UNK> there .    1394.4366
In a Greek <UNK> he breathed his last : <UNK> .    1026.6127
Turn back .    164.2930
<UNK> people , proud that their <UNK> son was in the <UNK> .    837.1273
He went in , bowing his head under the low <UNK> .    509.0855
That ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you .    369.8598
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot , a squashed <UNK> <UNK> .    709.7422
<UNK> always for a word of help his hand moved <UNK> the <UNK> symbols , a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> behind his dull skin .    1387.1748
Mr Deasy halted , breathing hard and <UNK> his breath .    942.1757
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is <UNK> it .    677.6995
<UNK> friend , a brother soul : Wilde ’ s love that dare not speak its name .    678.7392
For Haines ’ s <UNK> .    148.9480
<UNK> and <UNK> : lean neck and <UNK> hair and a <UNK> of ink , a <UNK> ’ s bed .    609.3162
<UNK> , <UNK> of all <UNK> <UNK> to man .    849.1849
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower , his razor and mirror <UNK> in the pocket where he had <UNK> them .    546.2101
<UNK> ?    296.9403
Are you a <UNK> student , sir ?    550.1498
Something like those <UNK> : it ’ s that <UNK> of bread : <UNK> <UNK> .    815.1826
And a third , Stephen said , there is who wants me for odd <UNK> .    605.6406
I want to know .    223.5535
He made money .    297.8537
Getting up in a <UNK> .    327.8536
I moved among them on the frozen <UNK> , that I , a <UNK> , among the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .    680.7280
Sure he ’ s not down in <UNK> terrace with his aunt <UNK> ?    653.9225

And you <UNK> .    394.9459
The dog ’ s bark ran towards him , <UNK> , ran back .    591.4583
Buck Mulligan asked .    294.3344
<UNK> Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the <UNK> .    688.6849
First , our little <UNK> <UNK> , he said .    462.8200
My <UNK> , after me , calling , <UNK> !    560.7714
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs . Will send when <UNK> .    897.7195

Ah , to be sure !    278.8481
<UNK> <UNK> .    607.7162
That on his empire , Stephen said , the sun never <UNK> .    292.6497
Heigho !    225.4773
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the <UNK> .    927.3563
O yes , W . Remember your <UNK> written on green oval leaves , deeply deep , copies to be sent if you died to all the great <UNK> of the world , <UNK> <UNK> ?    963.2631
He <UNK> the <UNK> of my art as I fear that of his .    584.4952
But he must send me La <UNK> de J <UNK> by M . L o <UNK> .    2049.8142
She never let them in , he cried again through his laughter as he <UNK> on <UNK> feet over the gravel of the path .    656.1526
Cranly ’ s arm .    44.1244
From me , Kinch , he said .    95.1196

Can pay ten down and the <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> .    1096.9689
He smiled , pouring .    252.1767
Just say in the most <UNK> tone : when I was in Paris ; <UNK> ’ <UNK> ’ , I used to .    713.4523
It <UNK> me too .    818.7583
<UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> , <UNK> her both <UNK> .    1600.9258
Still his <UNK> takes the harm out of it somehow , doesn ’ t it ?    514.3241
Couldn ’ t ask him at a funeral , though .    283.6746
I ’ d like to go but I <UNK> ’ t be able , you see .    544.0770
Open it .    82.8872
The <UNK> jesuit !    4770.7861
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly .    592.2952
<UNK> by the edge of the <UNK> he <UNK> , <UNK> , smelt a rock and from under a <UNK> hindleg pissed against it .    702.2740
<UNK> too far last time .    708.5486
You pay eighty <UNK> and they <UNK> a <UNK> of land for you with olives , <UNK> , <UNK> or <UNK> .    1434.0216

<UNK> still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it .    286.8856
All dimpled cheeks and <UNK> , Your head it simply <UNK> .    1539.6628
The <UNK> of God on you !    724.1473
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said : What ?    861.2269
I will tell you , he said <UNK> , what is his proudest <UNK> .    521.7200
She liked <UNK> .    1099.9373
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps .    784.8129
I have just to <UNK> the end .    495.5135

Yes , of course , he said , as they went on again .    201.8341
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with <UNK> <UNK> eyes .    1078.8600
There ’ s nothing wrong with him <UNK> at night .    426.5003
You and me , don ’ t you know : in the same boat .    232.2456
We can drink it black , Stephen said thirstily .    515.0169
She <UNK> up out of her <UNK> <UNK> eyes , mewing <UNK> and long , showing him her <UNK> teeth .    1221.1714
She turned over <UNK> that time .    839.5402
