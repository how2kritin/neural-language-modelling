Stephen filled again the three cups .    598.5915
Time I used to try <UNK> down on my <UNK> what she said dressing .    786.4811
Their likes : their breaths , too , sweetened with tea and <UNK> , their <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> .    506.7355

That was in his eyes .    20.0408
The <UNK> shavingbowl <UNK> , forgotten , on the parapet .    651.4247
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again , murmuring here and there a word .    283.3378
Tell about places you have been , strange <UNK> .    930.8420
Talbot <UNK> : Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves , Through the dear might . . .    656.1705

Mulligan said , glancing at her .    18.0099
He would be eleven now if he had lived .    330.8209
Useless : can ’ t move .    91.3132

He had reached the open backdoor of All <UNK> .    1099.0308
Where is his <UNK> ?    256.1256

His eyes open <UNK> in <UNK> stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted .    961.5573
There ’ s a word I wanted to ask you .    66.7811
Do you know what ?    13.5565

Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money .    508.0098
Tell her : more and more : all .    195.1807
He curled them between his <UNK> at <UNK> and swallowed them softly .    1044.8750
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly : Is this the day for your <UNK> wash , Kinch ?    276.6516

He <UNK> , <UNK> , stalked round it , brother , <UNK> <UNK> , went round it , <UNK> <UNK> like a dog all over the dead dog ’ s <UNK> fell .    555.1301
The priest went along by them , murmuring , holding the thing in his hands .    156.2135
He passed Saint Joseph ’ s <UNK> school .    1064.8870
He looked at the cattle , blurred in silver heat .    147.8700

He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh .    544.6169
Then he read the letter again : twice .    123.4229
<UNK> of <UNK> then and now .    260.0484
Sad too .    34.3816

He <UNK> swiftly at Stephen ’ s ashplant in <UNK> and , running forward to a brow of the cliff , <UNK> his hands at his sides like <UNK> or wings of one about to rise in the air , and <UNK> : Goodbye , now , goodbye !    255.6008
Comyn asked .    22.1333

He walked on .    55.5854
Still their <UNK> can be very <UNK> .    774.2971
He <UNK> it through his fingers <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> .    977.6543

By them , the man with my voice and my eyes and a <UNK> with ashes on her breath .    191.6418
From farther away , walking <UNK> across from the <UNK> tide , figures , two .    811.8449

<UNK> of all things I am here to read , <UNK> and <UNK> , the nearing tide , that <UNK> <UNK> .    468.8086
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband .    473.8693
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting .    242.7298
He strolled out to the doorway .    46.6649
The porter <UNK> the valise up on the well .    456.2014

I put a mark in it .    120.7988
I am , ma ’ am , Buck Mulligan answered .    39.5098
<UNK> back and pointing , Stephen said with <UNK> : It is a symbol of Irish art .    217.3140
That so ?    302.3237
The tea was drawn .    946.2950
Please tell me what you think of poor me .    114.7590
A <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> with shiny topboots .    3075.7129
<UNK> .    23.4353
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of <UNK> .    657.0785
<UNK> I going to aunt Sara ’ s or not ?    131.4366
Well , <UNK> .    112.4975

In the darkness of the <UNK> they wait , their <UNK> <UNK> , my <UNK> valise , around a board of <UNK> <UNK> .    642.8718
No use <UNK> her .    768.3403
Might work a press pass .    270.4804
Down , up , forward , back .    75.4403
I am trying to work up <UNK> with the <UNK> .    423.4951
Conmee : <UNK> <UNK> knows him : <UNK> .    1813.7528
My <UNK> , Blackwood <UNK> , <UNK> to me it is <UNK> treated and <UNK> in Austria by <UNK> there .    2049.7292
In a Greek <UNK> he breathed his last : <UNK> .    739.1150
Turn back .    79.8924
<UNK> people , proud that their <UNK> son was in the <UNK> .    627.5588
He went in , bowing his head under the low <UNK> .    309.4286
That ’ s why she won ’ t let me have anything to do with you .    59.4447
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot , a squashed <UNK> <UNK> .    382.0946
<UNK> always for a word of help his hand moved <UNK> the <UNK> symbols , a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> behind his dull skin .    1127.5006
Mr Deasy halted , breathing hard and <UNK> his breath .    798.4333
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is <UNK> it .    501.1381
<UNK> friend , a brother soul : Wilde ’ s love that dare not speak its name .    550.1840
For Haines ’ s <UNK> .    89.2313

<UNK> , <UNK> of all <UNK> <UNK> to man .    1383.7382
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’ s and walked with him round the tower , his razor and mirror <UNK> in the pocket where he had <UNK> them .    236.5067
<UNK> ?    53.7816
Are you a <UNK> student , sir ?    146.6382
Something like those <UNK> : it ’ s that <UNK> of bread : <UNK> <UNK> .    974.9798
And a third , Stephen said , there is who wants me for odd <UNK> .    141.9382
I want to know .    61.2396
He made money .    401.9018
Getting up in a <UNK> .    75.0690
I moved among them on the frozen <UNK> , that I , a <UNK> , among the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .    494.1909
Sure he ’ s not down in <UNK> terrace with his aunt <UNK> ?    481.5782

And you <UNK> .    349.8723
The dog ’ s bark ran towards him , <UNK> , ran back .    310.7666
Buck Mulligan asked .    13.1101
<UNK> Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the <UNK> .    528.0451
First , our little <UNK> <UNK> , he said .    330.1947
My <UNK> , after me , calling , <UNK> !    357.6343
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs . Will send when <UNK> .    1911.6650

Ah , to be sure !    135.2370

That on his empire , Stephen said , the sun never <UNK> .    118.3753
Heigho !    7.6108
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the <UNK> .    562.5306
O yes , W . Remember your <UNK> written on green oval leaves , deeply deep , copies to be sent if you died to all the great <UNK> of the world , <UNK> <UNK> ?    773.4778
He <UNK> the <UNK> of my art as I fear that of his .    383.4301
But he must send me La <UNK> de J <UNK> by M . L o <UNK> .    1927.0856
She never let them in , he cried again through his laughter as he <UNK> on <UNK> feet over the gravel of the path .    298.2071
Cranly ’ s arm .    11.6116
From me , Kinch , he said .    12.9385

Can pay ten down and the <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> .    1800.4878
He smiled , pouring .    247.8262
Just say in the most <UNK> tone : when I was in Paris ; <UNK> ’ <UNK> ’ , I used to .    585.2998
It <UNK> me too .    658.6724
<UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> , <UNK> her both <UNK> .    3536.6514
Still his <UNK> takes the harm out of it somehow , doesn ’ t it ?    162.9217
Couldn ’ t ask him at a funeral , though .    105.0550
I ’ d like to go but I <UNK> ’ t be able , you see .    188.3915
Open it .    22.5693
The <UNK> jesuit !    2973.8210
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly .    162.6028
<UNK> by the edge of the <UNK> he <UNK> , <UNK> , smelt a rock and from under a <UNK> hindleg pissed against it .    523.5837
<UNK> too far last time .    309.3983

All dimpled cheeks and <UNK> , Your head it simply <UNK> .    2378.2764
The <UNK> of God on you !    299.4621
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said : What ?    195.1806
I will tell you , he said <UNK> , what is his proudest <UNK> .    197.1874
She liked <UNK> .    878.0992

Yes , of course , he said , as they went on again .    45.2746
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with <UNK> <UNK> eyes .    1174.9336
There ’ s nothing wrong with him <UNK> at night .    240.3578
You and me , don ’ t you know : in the same boat .    70.1665
We can drink it black , Stephen said thirstily .    263.4490
She <UNK> up out of her <UNK> <UNK> eyes , mewing <UNK> and long , showing him her <UNK> teeth .    1027.5697
She turned over <UNK> that time .    386.9169
Wait till I have a few pints in me first .    329.3354
The word <UNK> was written on the <UNK> .    1174.5723
