Irish , Buck Mulligan said .    110.2103
Ah , poor dogsbody !    498.5278
You were making tea , Stephen said , and went across the landing to get more hot water .    375.7137
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face .    661.3847
Come .    60.2716

He glanced round him .    396.3535
Letter .    60.4395
Where do you begin in this ?    451.1039
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called : Poldy !    723.3518
Where ’ s the sugar ?    159.1159
he said in answer .    149.6477
No - one .    200.4147
After he woke me last night same dream or was it ?    910.2140
Yes , yes , Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh .    309.6172
In Rodot ’ s Yvonne and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties , shattering with gold teeth chaussons of pastry , their mouths yellowed with the pus of flan br ton .    1160.6727
Then , catching sight of Stephen Dedalus , he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air , gurgling in his throat and shaking his head .    419.3956
Know that old lay ?    421.3431
I ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows .    339.6638
Then a sigh : silence .    282.2574

He folded it under his armpit , went to the door and opened it .    268.2560
Stephen listened in scornful silence .    799.0927
Ah , see now !    271.5114
I am among them , among their battling bodies in a medley , the joust of life .    474.5454

I am getting on nicely in the dark .    329.3814
Will happen , yes .    222.7525
A sleepy soft grunt answered : Mn .    1151.3070

A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up .    376.3527
Stately , plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead , bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed .    441.6074

They wash and tub and scrub .    544.9162
Put a pin in that chap , will you ?    250.8539
O , jay , there ’ s no milk .    185.4031
He shaved warily over his chin .    723.0176
Hence those snores .    546.8919
Fed and feeding brains about me : under glowlamps , impaled , with faintly beating feelers : and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld , reluctant , shy of brightness , shifting her dragon scaly folds .    654.8889
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket .    948.7646
Rank heresy for them .    271.5103

The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea .    2040.8601
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells .    887.8024
Why should I bring it down ?    506.6398
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm .    1119.5876
You were a student , weren ’ t you ?    272.6343
There he is , sure enough , my bold Larry , leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket .    766.0057
Reclaim the whole place .    394.7608
Stephen Dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck .    471.2500
Rather warm .    209.3041
Ay .    60.4579
The sun is there , the slender trees , the lemon houses .    331.2385
What , sir ?    137.5949
Night hours then : black with daggers and eyemasks .    608.8991
Books you were going to write with letters for titles .    522.8569
Feels locked out of it .    148.6638
Glad to hear that , old man .    166.2383
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat , took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband .    415.4854
Blotchy brown brick houses .    1192.8893
Explain that : morning hours , noon , then evening coming on , then night hours .    387.4645
A crazy queen , old and jealous .    502.3986
All soil like that without dung .    774.4174
It has waited so long , Stephen said listlessly , it can wait longer .    537.0449
That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good .    623.5079
I am quiet here alone .    645.6954
Three times a day , after meals , Stephen said drily .    327.5875
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality .    459.5624
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone : Wait till you hear him on Hamlet , Haines .    412.7690
I am , a stride at a time .    196.1609
The dog yelped running to them , reared up and pawed them , dropping on all fours , again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning .    710.9193
Who chose this face for me ?    594.7548
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread .    452.2161
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub .    1867.3057
He slunk back in a curve .    350.0278
I pass .    213.5643
After , Stephen said .    60.8789
Easy now .    108.5550
We must go to Athens .    438.4682
But ours is the omphalos .    288.9428
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it .    781.7204
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile , wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace .    853.9236
She was reading the card , propped on her elbow .    356.5518
They don ’ t seem to chew it : only swallow it down .    446.2765
Sit down .    96.8242
She said it would look nice over the bed .    423.7127
The earth .    185.7618
The grub is ready .    583.4982
Her door was open : she wanted to hear my music .    561.9642
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor .    438.6836
You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose .    578.4434
He turned from the tray , lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire .    338.4991
Tranquility sudden , vast , candescent : form of forms .    431.6119
he said kindly .    241.5329
And one shilling threepence change .    1091.0236
I pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room , Buck Mulligan said .    222.6333
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth .    1143.7750
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now .    625.3539
Metempsychosis , he said , is what the ancient Greeks called it .    224.6139
Later on , Haines said .    89.6553
He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy , filing consents and common searches and a writ of Duces Tecum .    1034.1501
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate , patron of arts in the middle ages .    1149.2864
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket , reviewing again the soldiers on parade .    622.8511
They are not to be thought away .    369.8141
Listening , he heard her voice : Come , come , pussy .    285.7501
A hoard heaped by the roadside : plundered and passing on .    614.2351
There ’ s nothing smutty in it .    231.6067
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too .    416.5624
Gone too from the world , Averroes and Moses Maimonides , dark men in mien and movement , flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world , a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend .    641.9377
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured .    417.4968
<NUMBER> .    60.2737
There ’ s your snotrag , he said .    129.1290
Household slops .    285.7547
Yet someone had loved him , borne him in her arms and in her heart .    403.5167
Then the next one : a small old woman .    312.5341
O , that ’ s all only all right .    161.6941
New blood .    174.4667
I taught him to sing The boys of Kilkenny are stout roaring blades .    1564.7773
Give hands , traverse , bow to partner : so : imps of fancy of the Moors .    430.9731
Knows the taste of them now .    174.7272
A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him , listlessly holding her battered caskhoop .    1301.8185
Half day , sir .    106.9065
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament .    677.5156
And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek .    652.9952
Miaow !    145.6794
Heigho !    145.4962
Bad as a row with Molly .    409.4928
In gay Paree he hides , Egan of Paris , unsought by any save by me .    717.1295
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot .    826.3383
She didn ’ t want anything .    344.2720
The quick touch .    462.5775
That ’ s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter .    547.6816
Dirty cleans .    470.8278
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction .    988.0317
Somewhere in the east : early morning : set off at dawn .    577.4391
Look clock .    341.0966
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call , then paused awhile in rapt attention , his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points .    832.6260
Yes , Mr Deasy said .    133.7066
A barren land , bare waste .    1164.7328
I shall die !    1615.7579
I just wanted to say , he said .    186.5960
Stephen turned away .    258.3357
My tablets .    431.3346
Ask me , sir , Comyn said .    132.7551
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet .    917.4386
His hand groped vainly in his pockets .    481.0497
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself .    419.6006
Skin breeds lice or vermin .    969.7608
Poor papa !    734.4907
Too hot to quarrel .    421.5240
No , no , Buck Mulligan shouted in pain .    282.6451
Monkwords , marybeads jabber on their girdles : roguewords , tough nuggets patter in their pockets .    964.9406
You told the Clongowes gentry you had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army .    540.7231
Silence , all .    53.4547
The sum was done .    757.2468
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush , faded , the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles : world without end .    756.2750
I know , I know .    144.2630
One moment .    173.8117
A tide westering , moondrawn , in her wake .    396.8299
Milk for the pussens , he said .    103.0030
Petals too tired to .    240.3937
I fear those big words , Stephen said , which make us so unhappy .    608.3334
Evening will find itself .    594.9483
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window .    660.2682
Paysayenn .    60.4193
Pepper .    60.4283
The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath .    825.4774
Noon slumbers .    311.9160
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up , saying tritely : Redheaded women buck like goats .    724.4602
He turned to Stephen , saying , as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat : You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints , Kinch , could you ?    512.1401
Lulls all pain .    283.6237
As he and others see me .    253.1344
No .    59.9701
I ’ m going , Mulligan , he said .    97.4532

Dear Henry , when will we meet ?    674.5715
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God .    412.4794
He emptied his pockets on to the table .    221.0870
Whusky !    145.6733
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe , grey .    430.5112
Come in , ma ’ am , Mulligan said .    118.4993
He himself ?    416.5847
A poet , yes , but an Englishman too .    428.0583
We are a generous people but we must also be just .    1030.8633
The scrotumtightening sea .    635.7327

Who watches me here ?    655.1175
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree .    846.4012
Bread , butter , honey .    153.1508
Sex breaking out even then .    578.3231
He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock , resting his ashplant in a grike .    471.4840
Listen .    60.3065
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him .    716.2614
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy .    941.5074
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour , bids her rise .    931.9959
Stephen asked , opening another book .    469.7408
Patrice , home on furlough , lapped warm milk with me in the bar MacMahon .    481.0765
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles , breathing upward sewage breath , a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man ’ s ashes .    863.7299
Good fallback .    363.5695
M ’ Coy nodded , picking at his moustache stubble .    546.1127

Snotgreen , bluesilver , rust : coloured signs .    540.9588
he cried thickly .    568.4127
Personally I couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal God .    376.2876
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster , her sails brailed up on the crosstrees , homing , upstream , silently moving , a silent ship .    510.7951
Mrs Ellis ’ s .    121.3663
Clean to see : the gloss of her sleek hide , the white button under the butt of her tail , the green flashing eyes .    400.9690
What does she say ?    445.0196
A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace ( descende !    924.8114
I have seen it coming these years .    725.4862
Milly too .    105.6870
Met him what ?    284.0527
Who has not ?    302.8785
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom .    401.3607
You don ’ t know yet what money is .    411.3039
Poldy !    145.6250
Not unlike her with her hair down : slimmer .    469.4706
The cords of all link back , strandentwining cable of all flesh .    673.0030
Mon fils , soldier of France .    419.5274

He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes .    395.5390
Come .    60.2716
Lap it up like milk , I suppose .    216.2257
Has all vanished since ?    1238.2994

In cups of rocks it slops : flop , slop , slap : bounded in barrels .    612.6915
Full stop , Mr Deasy bade his keys .    547.6672
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street .    463.6616
Crown of thorns and cross .    360.2028
That do ?    283.9760

Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder .    699.1030
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily .    750.5793
Time shocked rebounds , shock by shock .    937.1725
As regards these , he began .    298.0927
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles , dancing coins .    753.6439

Not hurt ?    835.9183
He opened the letter within the newspaper .    340.2981
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees .    506.8445
A mason , yes .    256.0078
And twopence , he said , for a pint .    136.6540
Answered anyhow .    251.2944
He moved a little to the side of M ’ Coy ’ s talking head .    273.8408
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips , entranced , listening .    483.8219
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary .    609.9962

Perhaps I am wrong .    297.3232
Full gluey woman ’ s lips .    274.6799
Secrets , silent , stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts : secrets weary of their tyranny : tyrants , willing to be dethroned .    771.0302
That was the rule , said .    109.8399
Son of the wild goose , Kevin Egan of Paris .    392.8964
No - one saw : tell no - one .    509.8118
The aunt thinks you killed your mother , he said .    343.1194
And , spent , its speech ceases .    499.5627
He has the key .    172.0969
Il croit ?    1005.4283
Poor man !    321.3327
Sir Lout ’ s toys .    326.9920
As I am .    106.5850
My mother ’ s a jew , my father ’ s a bird .    185.6680
Can ’ t see !    261.4877
He smiled , glancing askance at her mocking eyes .    547.2639
I ’ m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up .    543.3545
Farmhouse , wall round it , blurred cattle cropping .    512.7271
But , I say , Mulligan , you do make strong tea , don ’ t you ?    241.2135
The hens in the next garden : their droppings are very good top dressing .    972.7545
Known as Koch ’ s preparation .    335.8369
Sociable .    60.4090
Where ?    190.9527
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone .    180.1606
Not annoyed then ?    713.6680
Better ask Seymour that .    514.1395
Hello .    60.1424
The mockery of it !    305.7232
Moist pith of farls of bread , the froggreen wormwood , her matin incense , court the air .    410.0477
History , Stephen said , is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake .    294.2615
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente , not doing a hand ’ s turn all day .    551.2759
O how I long to meet you .    280.3434
he asked .    97.3780
No , nothing has happened .    451.7342
Girl ’ s sweet light lips .    292.2240
It must be a movement then , an actuality of the possible as possible .    403.3072
So much the better .    214.3389
Have you the key ?    201.2557
Stephen freed his arm quietly .    551.2480
Yes , sir .    65.2888
He halted .    284.7822
off it and put it neatly into her mouth .    340.0357
O , do , sir .    77.6755
Or a lilt .    225.5304
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right .    220.6464
Look at that now , she said .    104.7402
Bless us , O Lord , and these thy gifts .    530.0805
Citrons too .    105.7030
Then , gazing over the handkerchief , he said : The bard ’ s noserag !    374.4681
What Paddy ?    684.5077
Je ne crois pas en l ’ existence de Dieu .    2521.4817
Mulligan , nine pounds , three pairs of socks , one pair brogues , ties .    682.2192
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha .    994.0834
Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt from their pintpots , loudlatinlaughing : Euge !    1182.7029

So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes .    401.4360
But I will fight for the right till the end .    289.6434
Lovely spot it must be : the garden of the world , big lazy leaves to float about on , cactuses , flowery meads , snaky lianas they call them .    610.6984
Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately ?    892.6071
To no end gathered ; vainly then released , forthflowing , wending back : loom of the moon .    820.6047
Put down three and carry five .    528.2289
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock , carefully .    661.7718
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop .    695.5819
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions ?    1244.8229
Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee .    533.6017
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells : et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam : the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts , a chemistry of stars .    1196.7550
Yes , bread of angels it ’ s called .    190.2613
Open your eyes now .    205.9181
Thanks , old chap , he cried briskly .    250.9968
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa .    1053.0736
Go further next time .    636.9352
She tendered a coin , smiling boldly , holding her thick wrist out .    703.0724
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon : Heva , naked Eve .    960.3499
Yes , Mr Bloom said .    141.3614
Can ’ t he hear the difference ?    288.8982
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel .    821.9672
Who ’ s behind me ?    215.6083
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope , ripping it open in jerks .    473.1091
Young student .    226.6468
No great hurry .    671.4410
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript .    868.2983
It does .    150.4501
he said gaily .    236.3589
Comment ?    191.3764
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically .    760.9319
They were about him here and there , with heads still bowed in their crimson halters , waiting for it to melt in their stomachs .    582.0735
Sees me looking .    246.9476
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head , coach after coach .    1497.6859
That doctrine of laissez faire which so often in our history .    1052.8677
I want puce gloves and green boots .    888.8563

Or leave it there all day , forgotten friendship ?    693.7799
Music hall stage .    821.5831
What perfume does your wife use .    842.5070
In all the highest places : her finance , her press .    414.8029
Still they get their feed all right and their doss .    649.1357
O , rocks !    322.1584
Tiptop , thanks .    133.6445
Hokypoky penny a lump .    466.1695
Makes you feel young .    265.1628
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat .    791.1508
Threepence , please .    132.7599
Ffoo !    145.6683
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly : What is the matter ?    637.1481
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine .    1124.0918
O , Milly Bloom , you are my darling .    283.3523
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength .    645.0368
The King ’ s own .    206.3862
Mark my words , Mr Dedalus , he said .    162.9467
And skeweyed Walter sirring his father , no less !    1427.0999
The twining stresses , two by two .    471.0566
He stared at them proudly , piled stone mammoth skulls .    1134.3536
You could have knelt down , damn it , Kinch , when your dying mother asked you , Buck Mulligan said .    400.9212
Secondleg they should be .    344.6583
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay , his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly .    727.6984
You were going to do wonders , what ?    446.1563
After all , I should think you are able to free yourself .    505.0168
Walter squints vainly for a chair .    587.8481
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs , the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman , a butcher ’ s dame , nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange .    621.1611
O , weeping God , the things I married into !    517.6567
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches .    622.1494
Language no whit worse than his .    736.8667
What about that , eh ?    262.7286
Then , a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking : rumpled , shiny sole .    900.9185
I ’ m coming , Buck Mulligan answered .    225.6063
The air feeds most .    967.5410
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man ’ s stare .    376.3326
No .    59.9702
O , O .    83.9968
Lover , for her love he prowled with colonel Richard Burke , tanist of his sept , under the walls of Clerkenwell and , crouching , saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward in the fog .    532.2047
The other one , jar on her head , was getting the supper : fruit , olives , lovely cool water out of a well , stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown .    515.0253
Shouldering their bags they trudged , the red Egyptians .    598.7968
All .    60.3812
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes .    582.5022
He has washed the upper moiety .    703.8886
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly , shadowing the bay in deeper green .    630.7932
I see little hope , Stephen said , from her or from him .    214.7773
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves .    820.9123
Dringadring !    145.6669
He stood up , gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown , saying resignedly : Mulligan is stripped of his garments .    580.3284
Buck Mulligan asked .    134.8315
Rhythm begins , you see .    175.3171
And he said : Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy !    1278.1033
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin , twisted it round in his fingers and cried : A miracle !    617.1730
Moi , je suis socialiste .    1012.3751
I have my stick .    365.5890
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish : the last .    660.8878
He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet , laughing to himself .    486.0251
The shiny links , packed with forcemeat , fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs ’ blood .    851.8190
I . . . With him together down . . .    96.2173
No , sir .    65.3397
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa , chap ticking them off in a book , navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees .    750.1256
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor .    312.4841
Pretending to speak broken English as you dragged your valise , porter threepence , across the slimy pier at Newhaven .    912.4041
He threw it on the road .    208.7630
You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street .    862.9152
The crooked skirt swinging , whack by whack by whack .    972.6005
Good morning , sir , Stephen said again , bowing to his bent back .    199.0311
They swarmed loud , uncouth about the temple , their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats .    1186.0830
Chucked medicine and going in for the army .    287.3760
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam .    726.6377
No use canvassing him for an ad .    777.3353
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted .    739.8339
Mr Bloom , strolling towards Brunswick street , smiled .    626.8703
We ’ ll be choked , Buck Mulligan said .    263.7813
Maud Gonne ’ s letter about taking them off O ’ Connell street at night : disgrace to our Irish capital .    727.0020
About a million barrels all the same .    326.0020
To Caesar what is Caesar ’ s , to God what is God ’ s .    234.3967
Just C . P . M ’ Coy will do .    308.2731
Goes like this .    196.5326
Is it Paddy Dignam ?    823.9760
Naked nymphs : Greece : and for instance all the people that lived then .    484.3785
If anyone thinks that I amn ’ t divine He ’ ll get no free drinks when I ’ m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again .    1115.3440
Simple bit of paper .    194.1924
Eleven , is it ?    85.6870
I know the voice .    156.2105
Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head .    908.2240
He stood suddenly , his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil .    541.3884
Spurned and undespairing .    278.9556
Yet here ’ s a spot .    148.1446
Give us that key , Kinch , Buck Mulligan said , to keep my chemise flat .    390.2380
Meade ’ s timberyard .    150.1071
Dying , he said again , if not dead by now .    211.4467
Why ?    191.0308
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree , for instance .    733.0380
My missus has just got an engagement .    1069.0497
Doesn ’ t see me .    134.7355
A thing out in the water .    149.3623
Square it you with the boss and we ’ ll split the job , see ?    312.4407
What ’ s left us then ?    410.7309
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers , leaned upon his spear .    791.7448
Like me , like Algy , coming down to our mighty mother .    404.3746
In a moment they will laugh more loudly , aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay .    635.1019
And past Nichols ’ the undertaker .    420.3712
Influence of the climate .    138.5185
Watering cart .    410.2096
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner , nursing his hat and newspaper .    529.7290
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers .    578.9602
Buck Mulligan said .    77.8181
He ’ s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks , is he ?    577.8826
Why , sir ?    137.6399
I don ’ t mince words , do I ?    348.8087
All I can give you I give .    300.2636
Her head dancing .    426.7646
Down , sir !    182.5685
Poor old professor Goodwin .    757.0121
Haines sat down on a stone , smoking .    261.6117
Wombed in sin darkness I was too , made not begotten .    505.8177
So warm .    209.1594
Darkness is in our souls do you not think ?    471.4013
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker .    283.1100
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight ?    296.8534
Drink water scented with fennel , sherbet .    674.6358
And when I makes water I makes water .    649.3422
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch .    721.2825
Silly Milly ’ s birthday gift .    474.5646
The only true thing in life ?    821.2725
She serves me at his beck .    381.7568
Where ?    190.9529
If I fell over a cliff that beetles o ’ er his base , fell through the nebeneinander ineluctably !    891.2823
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees , hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield .    414.5660
I see you ’ re . . . O , no , Mr Bloom said .    104.7899
Why , I wonder .    126.8835
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand , a rag of wolf ’ s tongue redpanting from his jaws .    550.1381
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair .    640.1346
I ’ m coming , Stephen said , turning .    139.7914
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth , hiding and revealing its yellow glow .    778.1312
Six weeks off , however .    353.0875
Yes , sir .    65.2887
Just loll there : quiet dusk : let everything rip .    1489.8992
A bit at a time .    187.5710
Ay !    145.7283
Ceasing , he began to shave with care .    364.2650
Not this Monsieur , I said .    174.8043
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets .    453.4105
You know , Dedalus , you have the real Oxford manner .    361.3815
Cough it up .    77.9750
He put the huge key in his inner pocket .    521.9457
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’ s face .    383.0841
Then the next one .    153.2464
He ’ s English , Buck Mulligan said , and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland .    310.9709
It ’ s about the foot and mouth disease .    275.8742
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here .    1118.8405
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day .    417.6386
Well : slainte !    710.5759
I will see if I can see .    388.1069
Your postprandial , do you know that word ?    439.2651
Here .    60.3273
She raised a gloved hand to her hair .    415.7906
A merchant , Stephen said , is one who buys cheap and sells dear , jew or gentile , is he not ?    468.2186
Haines , who had been laughing guardedly , walked on beside Stephen and said : We oughtn ’ t to laugh , I suppose .    474.6975
He has nowhere to put it , you mug .    308.2540
He threw it .    177.0619
Other stocking .    373.0916
To come to the point at issue .    350.9469
Red carpet spread .    689.0193
Old style .    372.5695
But one day you must feel it .    317.2230
No , sir .    65.3397
There again : the overtone following through the air .    304.5213
Three times now .    242.6506
He held the page aslant patiently , bending his senses and his will , his soft subject gaze at rest .    614.5518
On earth as it is in heaven .    261.8094
Here , she said .    59.6926
He stooped and gathered them .    457.1591
Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again , he said , and show them to you , sir .    215.2902
A quart , Stephen said .    132.6268
The way of all our old industries .    405.3453
Very well then , I contradict myself .    433.3861
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail .    666.5332
Cocklepickers .    60.4060
He thinks you ’ re not a gentleman .    265.8683
My father gave me seeds to sow .    663.7966
You pique my curiosity , Haines said amiably .    577.0381
Pert little piece she was .    428.8330
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard , their land a pawnshop .    821.9393
I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms , who left the house of his father and left the God of his father .    371.6837
Dead : an old woman ’ s : the grey sunken cunt of the world .    279.5776
He turned over the smudged pages .    445.5052
What time ?    390.3407
Lascivious people .    221.9400
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars : priest with a scroll rolled up .    621.2589
And he said : Another victory like that and we are done for .    490.6358
He turned back quickly , coughing , laughing , his lifted arms waving to the air .    397.6176
This dogsbody to rid of vermin .    411.0130
A pier , sir , Armstrong said .    162.5509
I suppose I did say it .    299.5149
After a silence Cochrane said : What is it , sir ?    350.5279
Click does the trick .    271.4332
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by , amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss .    723.5663
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall .    771.7198
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble , fanshoals of fishes , silly shells .    523.0956
By a woman who was no better than she should be .    715.7441
No wind could lift those waves , grey metal , poisonous foggy waters .    1181.3840
At Plevna that was .    281.5216
Was given milk too long .    627.6075
Pointed cuffs .    438.1902
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh .    1114.5162
They followed the winding path down to the creek .    359.7742
With it an abode of bliss .    445.5060
Try it anyhow .    199.6956
he asked , turning .    151.7585
God , isn ’ t he dreadful ?    330.0024

Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips .    259.4264
It came nearer up the staircase , calling again .    414.9748
As it was in the beginning , is now .    126.9604
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom .    606.0020
Well , sir , he began .    102.4444
Now could you make out a thing like that ?    386.4648
There ’ s whatdoyoucallhim out of .    141.8436
He walked off quickly round the parapet .    424.9789
I ’ m quite frank with you .    371.9299
Redcoats .    60.4046
Will happen too .    347.4679
A hand plucking the harpstrings , merging their twining chords .    926.4803
Is she up the pole ?    294.2928
He said .    58.5712
The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand , crouched in flight .    859.6838
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face .    742.7692
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness .    942.0588
We give it up .    168.7092
Doesn ’ t see .    110.9138
She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man , madame in rue G t - le - C ur , canary and two buck lodgers .    1519.7985
I ’ m swelled after that cabbage .    538.3376
Loose tobaccoshreds catch fire : a flame and acrid smoke light our corner .    1322.8066
Open hallway .    593.5576
You have eaten all we left , I suppose .    448.3250
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands .    857.3871
Bread and butter , four , sugar , spoon , her cream .    255.4836
That woman at midnight mass .    636.0238
Something new and easy .    312.3563
How much ?    529.4997
Cat furry black ball .    1047.8966
Good day to you .    98.5352
The protestants are the same .    294.9644
Out of her clothes somewhere : pinned together .    677.0164
Still he knows his own business best .    590.8391
Thanks , old man .    123.4702
Chapped : washingsoda .    241.8384
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them , chiding them , and to his dangling watchchain .    480.0261
Look at yourself , he said , you dreadful bard !    321.9131
He came to the table , pinning together his sheets .    339.7172
Dominie Deasy kens them a ’ .    209.5090
Goodbye now , naughty darling , I have such a bad headache .    471.2979
Soft soft soft hand .    344.8137
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent , ending .    447.8940
Police tout .    297.5688
Hello .    60.1423
Give her too much meat she won ’ t mouse .    724.8662
Coming out of her shell .    213.6288
Tell Pat you saw me , won ’ t you ?    305.6607
Josssticks burning .    312.3706
Illustration .    60.3848
Fine .    60.4017
Disguises , clutched at , gone , not here .    194.8088
Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker .    373.8645
If Wilde were only alive to see you !    883.2286
My Latin quarter hat .    651.3697
He will ask for it .    214.4882
Loam , what is this that is ?    217.1345
O si , certo !    929.1069
By Jove , it is tea , Haines said .    156.9365
Well ?    190.9785
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning .    346.4080
All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream , Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf .    430.2670
I am not a strong swimmer .    507.5633
Mrkgnao !    145.6653
Janey Mack , I ’ m choked !    430.3919
And here crowns .    367.0311
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry .    544.5162
Would you like a cup , ma ’ am ?    271.2489
On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall , paused by the bedroom door .    426.8101
Quietly he read , restraining himself , the first column and , yielding but resisting , began the second .    377.4645
Shoot him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun , bits man spattered walls all brass buttons .    1064.0927
Brimstone they called it raining down : the cities of the plain : Sodom , Gomorrah , Edom .    388.2807
Gabble of geese .    239.6321
he asked .    97.3780
There ’ s five fathoms out there , he said .    217.7309
It called again .    176.6322
But it has a Hellenic ring , hasn ’ t it ?    420.0108
Two , he said , strapping and stowing his pocketbook away .    272.2342
The ballad of joking Jesus , Stephen answered .    495.6536
Wake this time next year .    680.9767
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair .    727.5117
All days make their end .    646.7736
Down in Westmeath .    238.2731
Joseph the Joiner ?    477.2042
Some laughed again : mirthless but with meaning .    739.2253
Enthusiast .    60.3992
Yes , but W is wonderful .    500.0175
Better find out in the paper .    160.3163
What a lark .    289.9362
My consubstantial father ’ s voice .    314.4981
Stephen , still trembling at his soul ’ s cry , heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words .    488.3091
Like him was I , these sloping shoulders , this gracelessness .    451.7111
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong .    602.7920
Wonder did she wrote it herself .    567.9825
Make hay while the sun shines .    897.8582
Or through M ’ Coy .    260.7563
Elfin riders sat them , watchful of a sign .    391.2361
Epi oinopa ponton .    956.2155
Doing the indignant : a girl of good family like me , respectable character .    472.0361
Cruel .    60.4003
The lump I have is useless .    467.6082
Do you think she was ?    316.1917
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror , while all prayed on their knees .    1093.4788
Iubilantium te virginum .    1152.8419
They clasped and sundered , did the coupler ’ s will .    337.2893
Lump of love .    152.9330
Yes .    59.9495
Biting her nether lip , hooking the placket of her skirt .    588.5036
I couldn ’ t believe it when I heard it .    329.2786
I didn ’ t mean to offend the memory of your mother .    354.8957
Cries of sellers in the streets .    194.4498
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe , linked together in the rain .    416.3106
I never borrowed a shilling in my life .    504.6810
Stop and say a word : about the funeral perhaps .    346.5995
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it .    525.8894
The seas ’ ruler , he gazed southward over the bay , empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins .    553.5108
Night sky , moon , violet , colour of Molly ’ s new garters .    391.6154
Travel round in front of the sun , steal a day ’ s march on him .    258.3252
A tolerant smile curled his lips .    982.5699
Well , meet him .    136.1935
Our mighty mother !    1046.7201
Remember .    60.3861
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam ’ s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death .    905.2903
The priest ’ s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly .    747.9380
Do you know what I ’ m going to tell you ?    328.8502
Fergus ’ song : I sang it alone in the house , holding down the long dark chords .    428.5305
What is that ?    120.6307
I forget .    274.1822
A little trouble about those white corpuscles .    1292.6482
Mrkrgnao !    145.6410
Curse your noisy pugnose .    1149.1444
Iago , Stephen murmured .    175.7947
He approached Larry O ’ Rourke ’ s .    377.4645
Percentage of salted horses .    477.7606
I ’ m hyperborean as much as you .    374.7503
A choir gives back menace and echo , assisting about the altar ’ s horns , the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs , tonsured and oiled and gelded , fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat .    688.9431
The virgin at Hodges Figgis ’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write .    719.0610
Encore deux minutes .    1233.5029
Clearly I can see today .    357.9572
Made him feel a bit peckish .    482.3145
Two in the back bench whispered .    366.7171
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar .    631.3644
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket .    263.4241
She listens with big dark soft eyes .    696.8584
The same young eyes .    378.4384
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay : it seems history is to blame : on me and on my words , unhating .    471.3826
Bleibtreustrasse <NUMBER> , Berlin , W . <NUMBER> .    328.5764
Prefer an ounce of opium .    531.1264
Hand in hand .    105.9863
Taking it easy with hand under his cheek .    411.9872
Buck Mulligan , hewing thick slices from the loaf , said in an old woman ’ s wheedling voice : When I makes tea I makes tea , as old mother Grogan said .    490.1817
Just there .    98.7755
Friend of the family .    97.7919
Life might be so .    394.9924
Stephen asked .    107.7959
His hand turned the page over .    291.3863
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus ?    866.0600
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate : toothless terrors .    757.0927
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek .    839.3489
They halted , looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale .    628.1479
A cored apple , filled with brown sugar , roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening .    613.2474
They have forgotten Kevin Egan , not he them .    412.8291
He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand towards the Pigeonhouse .    628.2635
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun .    1221.1562
Never read it .    100.9162
What is it now ?    161.3168
Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh ’ s library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas .    651.6297
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere ?    477.9450
Yes ?    190.5057
You fenians forget some things .    1194.1254
She poured more tea into her cup , watching it flow sideways .    755.5685
Metempsychosis , he said , frowning .    99.1277
Shells .    60.4033
Spooning with him last night on the pier .    270.3283
Good idea the Latin .    256.6828
And Monsieur Drumont , gentleman journalist .    907.1489
O , that ’ s all right .    102.2287
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets : choice blend , finest quality , family tea .    865.3986
Ripening now .    108.5403
What had Gretta Conroy on ?    1240.8635
Stephen ’ s hand , free again , went back to the hollow shells .    240.9128
That means the transmigration of souls .    406.2294
A lex eterna stays about Him .    1817.6722
Strong pair of arms .    277.9829
Just you give it a fair trial .    365.1259
It does her all right .    271.8453
Ought I go to a dentist , I wonder , with that money ?    248.8659
I ’ m not a believer myself , that is to say .    224.2894
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching .    1539.7142
Conscience .    60.3919
No thanks at all , Mr Deasy said .    219.3842
I mean , a believer in the narrow sense of the word .    244.5901
The Father and the Son idea .    340.3565
The Ship , half twelve .    481.0738
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman ’ s mouth ?    571.2748
Talk that to someone else , Stevie : a pickmeup .    438.2190
He drones bars of Ferrando ’ s aria di sortita .    1328.6395
She praised the goodness of the milk , pouring it out .    259.6903
Moisture about gives long sight perhaps .    971.8425
Good morning , sir .    111.2991
Nosebag time .    149.0519
A woful lunatic !    2278.7402
So in the moon ’ s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks , in sable silvered , hearing Elsinore ’ s tempting flood .    563.5054
Terribilia meditans .    418.3492
I got a card from Bannon .    418.4214
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat .    371.5598
I ’ d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden .    967.1230
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting , went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors .    755.2958
For a woman who was no better than she should be , Helen , the runaway wife of Menelaus , ten years the Greeks made war on Troy .    753.2727

I will .    94.9092
Rinderpest .    60.3947
I fancy , Stephen said as he ate , it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion .    295.0934
Well ?    190.9783
He sighed down his nose : they never understand .    598.7499
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and .    356.4801
On the spindle side .    364.1146
The father is rotto with money .    476.4445
Sure we ought to , the old woman said , and I ’ m ashamed I don ’ t speak the language myself .    294.0739
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly .    988.1678
He laps .    498.2018
I am another now and yet the same .    300.4707
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it .    414.0381
A boat would be near , a lifebuoy .    428.1693
Three pounds three .    398.2104
Ah , wanted to go upstairs , curl up in a ball on the bed .    325.5094

I want puce gloves .    890.5062
Get another of Paul de Kock ’ s .    464.6507
All kings ’ sons .    338.0643
Common pin , eh ?    529.7366
I am a struggler now at the end of my days .    305.1584
Making his day ’ s stations , the dingy printingcase , his three taverns , the Montmartre lair he sleeps short night in , rue de la Goutte - d ’ Or , damascened with flyblown faces of the gone .    686.4021
I ’ m glad I didn ’ t go into the room to look at his face .    346.1514
You know that red Carlisle girl , Lily ?    911.0481
Croppies lie down .    356.5566
of course .    241.4691
A very short space of time through very short times of space .    1072.0187
That a man ’ s soul after he dies .    290.0576
Haines said .    58.5260
A voice within the tower called loudly : Are you up there , Mulligan ?    577.5129
Ireland , they say , has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews .    443.9311
Hook it quick .    170.8213
And the story , sir ?    192.7326
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips .    843.3061
Such a bad headache .    364.1241
Jesus wept : and no wonder , by Christ !    547.0015
Hands stuck in his trousers ’ pockets , jarvey off for the day , singing .    300.9863
On the night of the seventeenth of February <NUMBER> the prisoner was seen by two witnesses .    605.6210
I ’ ll show you my likeness one day .    446.2538
What have you up your nose against me ?    509.8398
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead : And no more turn aside and brood Upon love ’ s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars .    1059.3323
Better buy one .    404.8234
Well , perhaps it was best for him .    247.1476
Heavy of the past .    92.8415
Women all for caste till you touch the spot .    525.5435
Sit down or by the law Harry I ’ ll knock you down .    450.3937
His plump body plunged .    828.9410
But he adds : in bodies .    303.2982
That one .    85.6945
Time enough .    186.3480
What else were they invented for ?    890.8378
Runs , she runs to meet me , a girl with gold hair on the wind .    294.6519
Esprit de corps .    640.6058
Someone was to read them there after a few thousand years , a mahamanvantara .    463.6423
Thank you : not having any .    270.7010
We ’ ll see you again , Haines said , turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish .    346.0137
She might like something tasty .    899.1478
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice .    427.5602
O , Haines said , you have heard it before ?    220.2676
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father .    645.0098
May I trespass on your valuable space .    751.5986
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away , well in , and kneel an instant before it , showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on .    607.8066
Etiquette is etiquette .    280.5957
Her full lips , drinking , smiled .    358.7580
Haines said again .    99.1822
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe ’ s rooms .    872.0156
Careless air : just drop in to see .    327.5595
Prime sausage .    474.0546
Quarter to .    41.9925
A point , live dog , grew into sight running across the sweep of sand .    596.3898

he exclaimed .    394.2255
I said .    58.5264
Her first birthday away from home .    770.7423
The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus , he said .    488.5152
Do you know that ?    224.3919
He drank at her bidding .    523.8776
It ’ s Stephen , sir .    69.5144
God , we ’ ll simply have to dress the character .    360.6190
Got up wrong side of the bed .    257.6118
And Ristori in Vienna .    598.1821
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea , tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in .    531.2244
He creased out the letter at his side , reading it slowly as he chewed , sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth .    399.1571
Stephen sketched a brief gesture .    1039.5684
Castoff soldier .    282.0973
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy ’ s , clutching a naggin bottle by the neck .    645.1485

She lapped slower , then licking the saucer clean .    690.0497
Pity so empty .    432.3215
One and four into twenty : fifteen about .    670.0305
Like foul flowerwater .    1141.8530

That ’ ll be all right .    260.6217
To keep it up .    165.3955
Hray !    145.6496
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan ’ s ( I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan ’ s ) song about those seaside girls .    1096.0916

Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade .    305.8775
They sinned against the light , Mr Deasy said gravely .    405.7216
Nice name he has .    245.7361
Windows open .    190.7375
I will not sleep here tonight .    653.1568

He took the hilt of his ashplant , lunging with it softly , dallying still .    417.0987
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table , mewing .    554.3452
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief .    800.5942
Off the drunks perhaps .    427.1200

It ’ s nine days today .    436.1816

You ’ re not a believer , are you ?    238.8063
With mother ’ s money order , eight shillings , the banging door of the post office slammed in your face by the usher .    438.6577
Another time .    149.0639
One tabloid of cascara sagrada .    1052.7714
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger , teadust , biscuitmush .    651.9315
In the trousers I left off .    304.2815
Wander through awned streets .    748.3143

Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers ’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles .    551.5688
My handkerchief .    238.1824
the cat said loudly .    334.7641
Give you the needle that would .    232.3130
He died on Monday , poor fellow .    472.4970
Always the same , year after year .    311.6532

I hear them at the piano downstairs .    368.7891
The truth , spit it out .    229.7674
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him , moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water .    547.8791
We did great biz yesterday .    1220.4229
Yes , what is it ?    133.9496
Per second per second .    868.7294
Kind of stuff you read : in the track of the sun .    210.6575
Might manage a sketch .    492.8669
A phrase , then , of impatience , thud of Blake ’ s wings of excess .    313.0675

Fabled by the daughters of memory .    261.9319
How are you ?    161.7435
Kingstown pier , Stephen said .    105.6746
Stephen , an elbow rested on the jagged granite , leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve .    745.6443
The soul is in a manner all that is : the soul is the form of forms .    248.3910
O , my name for you is the best : Kinch , the knife - blade .    336.6247
But I couldn ’ t go in that light suit .    359.6850
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses .    1009.1830
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech , confidently .    461.1832
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws , a lady of letters .    504.5787
Then feel all like one family party , same in the theatre , all in the same swim .    370.3759
Let me be and let me live .    356.7220
Ham and eggs , no .    156.8311
It bore the oldest , the first race .    413.7875
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last : Rather bleak in wintertime , I should say .    742.3635
They like them sizeable .    383.9282
That must be why the women go after them .    534.8314
Proudly walking .    164.9825
Funny I don ’ t remember that .    205.5545
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes .    878.2194

I would want to .    208.5887
Valise I have a particular fancy for .    351.0024
Well ?    190.9783
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back .    441.5785
They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently , Frauenzimmer : and down the shelving shore flabbily , their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand .    663.3542
he murmured to himself .    285.6902
What did you say that for ?    275.6040
Not like Ecce Homo .    987.8885
Families of them .    65.0938
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone .    1250.5731
Warm sunshine merrying over the sea .    582.7389
He leaned back and went on again , having just remembered .    424.3144
Sit down a moment .    166.9286
Some say they remember their past lives .    839.0756
Then he put a forkful into his mouth , chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat .    727.5433
Haines said , beginning to point at Stephen .    212.8983
Cup of tea now .    154.0717
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth , murmuring all the time .    407.9146
Who ’ s getting it up ?    234.8770
Of lost leaders , the betrayed , wild escapes .    478.6470
Turning the curve he waved his hand .    348.0936
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads .    863.5116
They all fall to the ground .    266.1282
Their Eldorado .    360.8258
Barrels bumped in his head : dull porter slopped and churned inside .    833.9293
On the hands down .    148.8093
He passed it along the table towards the old woman , saying : Ask nothing more of me , sweet .    371.4794
Are there any letters for me ?    541.7585
Buck Mulligan , walking forward again , raised his hands .    281.1775
No : that book .    144.7293
Stephen asked .    107.7961
She curtseyed and went out , followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant : Heart of my heart , were it more , More would be laid at your feet .    530.6857
He coasted them , walking warily .    426.8812
The drone of his misleading whistle brings Walter back .    1019.0890
Liliata rutilantium .    423.0434
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket .    809.9132
A flower .    268.0071
He liked thick giblet soup , nutty gizzards , a stuffed roast heart , liverslices fried with crustcrumbs , fried hencods ’ roes .    1305.9150
There he is .    62.7833
A server of a servant .    226.2312
No guts in it .    137.8609
Beauty is not there .    134.7825
I feel so bad about .    540.1363
The cat went up in soft bounds .    529.6919
He says it ’ s very clever .    344.1204
Usual love scrimmage .    857.8594
Well , I am here now .    181.3670
White breast of the dim sea .    324.5856
So .    60.2900
With the Bannons .    240.7706
Why not endless till the farthest star ?    1528.0461
I thirst .    275.8775
Nothing doing .    291.7370
Eyes front .    306.4895
A million pounds , wait a moment .    427.9824
I hope that smallpox up there doesn ’ t get worse .    846.5853
Now that was farseeing .    327.1812
What ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet ’ s breezy . . . Goodbye , now , goodbye !    478.5431
Damn it .    51.2605
The king was in his countinghouse .    334.4974
Only five she was then .    279.3295
Heaviness : hot day coming .    387.8213
He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread , impaled on his knife .    598.0457
Your wife and my wife .    322.3161
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and , glancing at Haines and Stephen , crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone .    459.5394
Who was telling me ?    623.4460
Cheeseparing nose .    285.0291
That is Kevin Egan ’ s movement I made , nodding for his nap , sabbath sleep .    510.4659
The Ship , Buck Mulligan cried .    322.9652
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid ?    759.8337
Dogskull , dogsniff , eyes on the ground , moves to one great goal .    349.8693
Russell , one guinea , Cousins , ten shillings , Bob Reynolds , half a guinea , Koehler , three guineas , Mrs MacKernan , five weeks ’ board .    598.3857
Might be happy all the same that way .    330.3444
They take me for a dun , peer out from a coign of vantage .    421.7956
The new air greeted him , harping in wild nerves , wind of wild air of seeds of brightness .    587.4410
Let him stay , Stephen said .    147.0831
I think of you so often you have no idea .    401.8606
Would you like a bite of something ?    341.0869
The flood is following me .    462.0956
To provoke the rain .    407.8469
Not a bit funky .    379.3801
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers .    1193.4606
Of course I ’ m a Britisher , Haines ’ s voice said , and I feel as one .    218.0716
No , she can jump me .    286.0849
<NUMBER> B . C . Asculum , Stephen said , glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book .    298.0732
Spoils slung at her back .    274.4706
By the way no harm .    330.8827
I ’ d go if I possibly could .    699.4781
Softsoaping .    60.3890
Stephen rustled the sheets again .    372.8008
Buss her , wap in rogues ’ rum lingo , for , O , my dimber wapping dell !    657.4163
A kind of a bridge .    271.9309

I ’ m the bermensch .    182.5007
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts .    690.0396
Gone .    60.3892
A shout in the street , Stephen answered , shrugging his shoulders .    266.9022
Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea .    398.3093
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand , trotting , sniffing on all sides .    665.2640
What are you singing ?    386.9649
There is no time to lose .    324.5355
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn ’ t live .    768.7808
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head .    585.2881
From whom ?    806.1784
We ’ re always tired in the morning , Stephen said to Haines .    249.5886
It ’ s a law something like that .    237.4767
Coloured on a flat : yes , that ’ s right .    177.3161
M . Fifteen yesterday .    475.7567
Then what is it ?    167.3905
The cat , having cleaned all her fur , returned to the meatstained paper , nosed at it and stalked to the door .    433.3940
Just how she stalks over my writingtable .    844.8919
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone , in shirtsleeves , his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder .    398.6487
Gaze in your omphalos .    219.3532
Some people believe , he said , that we go on living in another body after death , that we lived before .    457.4895
Poor Dignam !    814.1787
Irish Homestead .    375.4286

Go on then , Talbot .    163.2855
Pyrrhus , sir ?    137.6406
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and , bending in loose laughter , said to Stephen ’ s ear : O , shade of Kinch the elder !    473.0654
Talk : as if that would mend matters .    646.4828
He walked along the upwardcurving path .    599.3221
Four shining sovereigns , Buck Mulligan cried with delight .    560.3501
Just one moment .    217.6845
Soft day , sir John !    453.3714
Hello , M ’ Coy .    149.9678
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland .    718.4407
Like to see her again in that .    147.4546
More tell me , more still !    475.9861
Would I make any money by it ?    490.3095
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday .    1710.4950
Haines stood at the doorway , looking out .    196.9949
That is why mystic monks .    947.2593
Mrs Marion .    493.0707
His arm .    201.6528
Have you read his F ?    419.7659
Buck Mulligan said .    77.8183
Number eighty still unlet .    1348.5609
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare ’ s ghost is Hamlet ’ s grandfather .    485.8186
You ’ ll look spiffing in them .    352.3841
Our prize titbit : Matcham ’ s Masterstroke .    672.1377
Must get those settled really .    1158.8379
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her .    460.4587
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word ?    437.5646
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow .    805.3666
Haines sat down to pour out the tea .    263.2946
Womb of sin .    150.4735
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows .    662.4054
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem .    359.5538
Watch !    145.5093
No black clouds anywhere , are there ?    865.1804
Say he got ten per cent off .    1024.1494
One of the best , M ’ Coy said .    159.2896
Hooray !    145.6417
O ’ Brien .    196.3187
They ’ re taught that .    258.9583
McCann , one guinea .    184.8189
To learn one must be humble .    900.3173
she cried , running to lap .    269.3575
With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table , with trousers down at heels , chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears .    601.4182
Thanks : new tam : Mr Coghlan : lough Owel picnic : young student : Blazes Boylan ’ s seaside girls .    1105.4656
The cracked lookingglass of a servant .    329.1392
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak .    796.1872
Her slim legs running up the staircase .    700.4747
Ah , poor dogsbody !    498.5278
God !    145.7910
And a letter for you .    118.9881
You had better get your stick and go out to the others , Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form .    386.4088
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes , rearing horses , rocks .    730.7925
Agendath Netaim : planters ’ company .    536.5161
Weary too in sight of lovers , lascivious men , a naked woman shining in her courts , she draws a toil of waters .    553.7213
At one , he said .    64.7778
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade .    360.6655
Costive .    60.3892
What is your idea of Hamlet ?    369.3199
Arbutus place : Pleasants street : pleasant old times .    884.9191
There ’ s only one sense of the word , it seems to me , Stephen said .    188.5505
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs , nebeneinander .    338.8082
Sleeping sickness in the air .    203.8755
Leaving the door ajar , amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces .    816.8292
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth .    835.0223
Cyril Sargent : his name and seal .    359.5026
It ’ s all right .    117.2234
The figures whitened in his mind , unsolved : displeased , he let them fade .    609.9545
Then he put on his hat again , relieved : and read again : choice blend , made of the finest Ceylon brands .    496.3485
Hair ?    191.2818
Shut your eyes and see .    181.4382
I hear .    135.1913
Who is my neighbour ?    535.8228
He faced about and back again .    374.6724
It suits me splendid .    738.8472
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone , scarcely having been .    1039.4276
All human history moves towards one great goal , the manifestation of God .    771.6724
The Russians , they ’ d only be an eight o ’ clock breakfast for the Japanese .    733.4918
E . . . eleven , Mr Bloom answered .    143.4394
Signs on a white field .    281.0460
Mr Deasy is calling you .    253.8234
But what does Shakespeare say ?    882.2458
Yes , Mr Bloom said .    141.3615
Old hag with the yellow teeth .    450.7747
Haines , come in .    96.0812
The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror , he said .    317.4814
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality .    516.0282
Twopence a pint , fourpence a quart , eightpence a gallon of porter , no , one and fourpence a gallon of porter .    368.1497
Table : able .    212.6228
His head disappeared and reappeared .    631.7158
The Evening Telegraph . . . That will do , Mr Deasy said .    255.3622
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him .    328.8551
Buck Mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight .    291.4190
Damn all else they are good for .    449.7220
Chewer of corpses !    602.3329
she said .    43.0630
Time enough , sir , she said , taking the coin .    159.8006
Fifteen multiplied by .    387.4902
Queer I was just thinking that moment .    422.4933
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord , hushed in ruddy wool .    962.2109
No , the dog .    78.9421
Then he went to the dresser , took the jug Hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him , poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor .    477.3881
Pier with lamps , summer evening , band .    460.9226
My twelfth rib is gone , he cried .    492.9877
Most licentious custom .    941.7431
Then think of the competition .    203.7301
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight , putting back his savingsbox .    661.8854
Keen glance you gave her .    330.1560
You might put down my name at the funeral , will you ?    405.3905
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings , darned with lumpy wool .    1285.3009
Why did you enclose the stamps ?    652.7966
Sleep six months out of twelve .    624.7435
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker .    320.7825
Where is my hat , by the way ?    180.5119
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up , roll over to the sun a puffy face , saltwhite .    761.1392
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after .    580.3923
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks , cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket , his hat tilted down on his eyes .    603.3674
Wife is oldish .    264.2857
They will walk on it tonight , coming here in the dark .    293.5770
He carried it upstairs , his thumb hooked in the teapot handle .    511.9609
Then , lo and behold , they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons .    1012.4229
Plasters on a sore eye .    433.1847
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly , an elbow on the pillow .    733.2873
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand .    208.4872
Reading , lying back now , counting the strands of her hair , smiling , braiding .    338.1231
Speaking to me .    67.6975
She asked you who was in your room .    311.4532
Cigar has a cooling effect .    661.2406
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly , showing an open copybook .    1287.0397
Hello , Bloom .    88.6537
No good eggs with this drouth .    748.8562
Listen .    60.3066
To evening lands .    598.9158
What is that , a bob here and there , dribs and drabs .    271.9184
Who ever anywhere will read these written words ?    1901.6714
And Mr ?    311.8723
It ’ s in the lock , Stephen said , coming forward .    140.0586
It sat there , dull and squat , its spout stuck out .    492.6778
Yes , my love ?    293.7393
Or was that only possible which came to pass ?    689.0623
No , they will pass on , passing , chafing against the low rocks , swirling , passing .    432.0779
Call away let him : thy quarrons dainty is .    930.1530
Talbot asked simply , bending forward .    464.7010
See now .    108.5352
I got mummy ’ s lovely box of creams and am writing .    722.8008
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were ?    1214.6566
Stephen said .    58.4585
A hard one , sir .    219.2080
Morning mouth bad images .    860.1143
Then come out a bit spreeish .    490.4982
It ’ s not fair to tease you like that , Kinch , is it ?    237.4628
It is very simple , Stephen said as he stood up .    276.5616
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter .    335.9477
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues .    474.8440
Poor papa !    734.4897
Nothing she can eat ?    544.7637
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke .    669.7207
The words troubled their gaze .    644.3129
Everything on it ?    133.5121
he asked .    97.3780
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack .    891.2903
Sir .    60.4232
They are waiting for him now .    301.6486
Now I ’ m going to try publicity .    357.0028
Inishboffin .    60.3982
Excuse bad writing .    538.1791
An example ?    855.4348
He saw their speeds , backing king ’ s colours , and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds .    514.6328
Save it they can ’ t .    166.7617
Give up the moody brooding .    433.9026
Not a word more on that subject !    573.3070
Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou .    4196.0103
No use thinking of it any more .    439.0590
Didn ’ t catch me napping that wheeze .    527.7866
I said .    58.5263
Stephen , shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart , said very coldly : I am not thinking of the offence to my mother .    492.4389
Nom de Dieu !    1455.7855
All the way from Gibraltar .    283.1182
In a suddenly changed tone he added : To tell you the God ’ s truth I think you ’ re right .    560.7679
Il est irlandais .    800.1439
Hard as nails at a bargain , old Tweedy .    446.5477
His arm : Cranly ’ s arm .    348.7789
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney .    716.3768
Perhaps he was a woman .    122.7962
Her hat sank at once .    477.3947
One moment .    173.8116
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him .    744.2746
That will do , Mr Deasy said briskly .    283.4004
With envy he watched their faces : Edith , Ethel , Gerty , Lily .    750.5042
Stephen asked her .    122.8742
Buck Mulligan said .    77.8182
He walked on , waiting to be spoken to , trailing his ashplant by his side .    344.1169
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect : Is there any . . . no trouble I hope ?    477.1350
I have a letter here for the press .    238.9901
What they called nymphs , for example .    406.8429
Who knows ?    493.2720
Soft mark .    398.9598
Where is she ?    148.4992
Japhet in search of a father !    348.9869
He shook his constraint from him nervously .    676.0070
I remember .    184.3021
Yes .    59.9496
You wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you .    549.5432
Far away now past .    393.1582
The aunt thinks you killed your mother .    659.8682
Living in a bogswamp , eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust , horsedung and consumptives ’ spits .    681.9659
Inishark .    60.3993
Got a short knock .    404.8811
he asked .    97.3780
Still I will help him in his fight .    339.7660
Vain : very .    141.2198
Stamps : stickyback pictures .    720.4664
Drago ’ s shopbell ringing .    394.6281
She gazed straight before her , inhaling through her arched nostrils .    879.3226
To the secretary of state for war , Stephen added over his shoulder .    453.9769
He ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman .    326.5828
Cleanchested .    60.4093
Rum idea : eating bits of a corpse .    532.1848
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim , rinsing empties and old man in the cellar .    766.8031
O let him !    508.4947
Bold hand .    114.7170
I get paid this morning , Stephen said .    343.3790
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen .    526.8075
He halted before Dlugacz ’ s window , staring at the hanks of sausages , polonies , black and white .    444.0602
And to think of your having to beg from these swine .    549.2437
You have two copies there .    585.0177
It wouldn ’ t pan out somehow .    499.0770
Bath a most private thing .    762.6188
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry : Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one , and Arius , warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father , and Valentine , spurning Christ ’ s terrene body , and    574.2183
the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son .    2205.4673
Ringsend : wigwams of brown steersmen and master mariners .    860.4478
I paid the rent .    440.0857
You , Cochrane , what city sent for him ?    494.6853
Ruins and tenements .    320.8059
He scrambled up by the stones , water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair , water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth .    674.0773
The coals were reddening .    1076.5183
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine .    534.2805
I forget the place , sir .    215.3689
Did I not take it up ?    302.7445
My wife too , he said .    130.1633
Ferm .    60.3968
Chopsticks ?    191.2826
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him .    1157.6118
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high .    550.0305
Looked shut .    269.1618
Why Ophelia committed suicide .    1958.3057
Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him , cleft by a crooked crack .    470.9645
What then ?    237.1922
Airs romped round him , nipping and eager airs .    692.5110
Yes , she said .    59.6000
The ghostcandle to light her agony .    658.6802
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O ’ Loughlin ’ s of Blackpitts .    765.3040
I told her to come after eight .    489.7690
He added in a preacher ’ s tone : For this , O dearly beloved , is the genuine Christine : body and soul and blood and ouns .    546.6669
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay .    442.7611
Poetical idea : pink , then golden , then grey , then black .    356.2990
) , the heat .    115.6170
You just shove in my name if I ’ m not there , will you ?    441.2159
Dan Occam thought of that , invincible doctor .    571.8499
Print anything now .    234.6437
He smiled , pleasing himself .    409.9421
Mulligan said .    58.5291
Stephen , taking his ashplant from its leaningplace , followed them out and , as they went down the ladder , pulled to the slow iron door and locked it .    396.5666
For whom ?    806.3695
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur ’ s yelping .    540.8478
They are coming , waves .    203.9734
No more letters , I hope .    280.8755
He can ’ t make you out .    200.1844
I ’ ll do that , Mr Bloom said , moving to get off .    249.4341
From the liberties , out for the day .    146.9571
Electric .    60.4071
He frowned sternly on the bright air .    460.8758
Go easy .    220.2804
I see you .    85.6429
His back is like that Norwegian captain ’ s .    372.1476
England is in the hands of the jews .    108.1514
The man ’ s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears .    969.4316
O , ask me , sir .    133.8398
Lourdes cure , waters of oblivion , and the Knock apparition , statues bleeding .    525.9059
Grand is no name for it , said Buck Mulligan .    195.9536
Heigho !    145.4960
Is it some paradox ?    729.9650
His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket .    369.6208
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you , only it ’ s injected the wrong way .    395.5475
A voice , sweettoned and sustained , called to him from the sea .    268.3510
Fading gold sky .    575.4169
Corpus : body .    141.3197
She knew at once .    351.0496
They understand what we say better than we understand them .    958.3083
Fierce Italian with carriagewhip .    945.7176
I am an Englishman , Haines answered .    328.8836
I think you ’ ll find that ’ s right .    234.8457
Because the weight of the water , no , the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what ?    172.5012
Touch him for a quid , will you ?    210.8347
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy ?    813.3506
Fred Ryan , two shillings .    391.4989
A whirring whistle : goal .    844.1215
Why ?    191.0312
Invent a story for some proverb .    489.6764
Now I eat his salt bread .    477.3831
There is a meeting of the cattletraders ’ association today at the City Arms hotel .    547.1071
It ’ s a wonderful tale , Haines said , bringing them to halt again .    325.8537
No .    59.9701
No , I didn ’ t .    118.9111
I am caught in this burning scene .    1009.7303
For you , please ?    189.8188
He felt heavy , full : then a gentle loosening of his bowels .    499.8094
O , that ’ s all right .    102.2287
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan .    534.1215
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted .    1055.0282
Are you not coming in ?    228.9088
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel .    702.5624
O , an impossible person !    1099.9163
Strange kind of music that last night .    524.0745
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff , watching : businessman , boatman .    385.9477
Old Father Ocean .    944.7548
And they are the signs of a nation ’ s decay .    264.5318
He moved to go .    217.0694
I ’ m sure of that .    160.4525
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail .    997.7120
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed .    756.1077
Mind you don ’ t get one bang on the ear .    340.4948
Where ?    190.9529
In came Hoppy .    568.1111
Hunger toothache .    457.9900
What have you against me now ?    382.9866
Bought it at the governor ’ s auction .    233.1874
To ourselves . . . new paganism . . . omphalos .    94.1966
I ’ m the only one that knows what you are .    275.2632
Hallstand too full .    278.2815
Doped animals .    294.7902
General paralysis of the insane !    728.6887
Fresh air helps memory .    806.6068
Poor little Paddy Dignam , he said .    273.2695
Sure ?    191.2968
For my sake and for all our sakes .    616.9456
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it .    560.6981
No sound .    290.9657
And and and and tell us , Stephen , how is uncle Si ?    410.3759
Lettuce .    60.4078
Stephen asked .    107.7959
Give him the key too .    218.8884
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently .    486.4927
No : better not : another time .    366.8229
I didn ’ t see the paper .    196.1929
Letters on his back : <URL>    472.4565
Do you understand now ?    369.2021
Pretenders : live their lives .    462.0436
Snapshot , eh ?    322.2118
To keep it up .    165.3958
It ’ s Greek : from the Greek .    193.3750
The banknotes , blast them .    388.0789
Ikey touch that : homerule sun rising up in the northwest .    460.8855
This is the riddle , Stephen said : The cock crew , The sky was blue : The bells in heaven Were striking eleven .    936.8901
