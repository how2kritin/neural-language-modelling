Ah , poor dogsbody !    31.8839
You were making tea , Stephen said , and went across the landing to get more hot water .    60.8602
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face .    131.0346
Come .    3.8504

Where do you begin in this ?    89.0588
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called : Poldy !    101.3954
Where ’ s the sugar ?    49.3920
he said in answer .    44.7807
No - one .    22.7080
After he woke me last night same dream or was it ?    288.5468
Yes , yes , Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh .    30.7800
In Rodot ’ s Yvonne and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties , shattering with gold teeth chaussons of pastry , their mouths yellowed with the pus of flan br ton .    138.4814
Then , catching sight of Stephen Dedalus , he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air , gurgling in his throat and shaking his head .    68.0269
Know that old lay ?    231.4046
I ’ m told it ’ s a grand language by them that knows .    66.1346
Then a sigh : silence .    117.7805

He folded it under his armpit , went to the door and opened it .    48.2828
Stephen listened in scornful silence .    287.4572
Ah , see now !    63.7760
I am among them , among their battling bodies in a medley , the joust of life .    84.9528

Will happen , yes .    42.3869
A sleepy soft grunt answered : Mn .    120.8783

Stately , plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead , bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed .    72.4756

They wash and tub and scrub .    118.3875
Put a pin in that chap , will you ?    39.4826
O , jay , there ’ s no milk .    39.5690
He shaved warily over his chin .    77.4229
Hence those snores .    121.9946
Fed and feeding brains about me : under glowlamps , impaled , with faintly beating feelers : and in my mind ’ s darkness a sloth of the underworld , reluctant , shy of brightness , shifting her dragon scaly folds .    143.2961
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket .    158.0800

Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells .    153.2173
Why should I bring it down ?    209.1749
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm .    225.8699
You were a student , weren ’ t you ?    22.0186
There he is , sure enough , my bold Larry , leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket .    191.2262
Reclaim the whole place .    47.1766
Stephen Dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck .    83.7168
Rather warm .    179.6924
Ay .    3.7063
The sun is there , the slender trees , the lemon houses .    102.3496
What , sir ?    22.0248
Night hours then : black with daggers and eyemasks .    204.1832
Books you were going to write with letters for titles .    122.7246
Feels locked out of it .    50.4968
Glad to hear that , old man .    51.9931
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat , took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband .    70.9566
Blotchy brown brick houses .    138.5572
Explain that : morning hours , noon , then evening coming on , then night hours .    165.4100

All soil like that without dung .    209.3100
It has waited so long , Stephen said listlessly , it can wait longer .    280.2618
That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good .    150.6413
I am quiet here alone .    164.0241
Three times a day , after meals , Stephen said drily .    95.4277
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality .    75.8298
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’ s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone : Wait till you hear him on Hamlet , Haines .    107.5532
I am , a stride at a time .    48.7505
The dog yelped running to them , reared up and pawed them , dropping on all fours , again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning .    150.6824

But ours is the omphalos .    84.0577
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it .    204.6105
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile , wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace .    147.6356
She was reading the card , propped on her elbow .    66.5096
They don ’ t seem to chew it : only swallow it down .    74.6721
Sit down .    41.0893
She said it would look nice over the bed .    178.2626
The earth .    68.9617
The grub is ready .    80.0851
Her door was open : she wanted to hear my music .    163.8560
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor .    56.8418
You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose .    136.8701
He turned from the tray , lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire .    53.7262
Tranquility sudden , vast , candescent : form of forms .    101.4350
he said kindly .    72.9889
And one shilling threepence change .    723.9218
I pinched it out of the skivvy ’ s room , Buck Mulligan said .    23.5179
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth .    292.8386
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now .    131.4507
Metempsychosis , he said , is what the ancient Greeks called it .    70.3294
Later on , Haines said .    32.9543
He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy , filing consents and common searches and a writ of Duces Tecum .    165.8549
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate , patron of arts in the middle ages .    209.7022
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket , reviewing again the soldiers on parade .    128.4522
They are not to be thought away .    165.2065
Listening , he heard her voice : Come , come , pussy .    105.4594
A hoard heaped by the roadside : plundered and passing on .    156.5159
There ’ s nothing smutty in it .    34.3432
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too .    97.4715
Gone too from the world , Averroes and Moses Maimonides , dark men in mien and movement , flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world , a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend .    160.0044
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured .    203.7633
<NUMBER> .    3.5889
There ’ s your snotrag , he said .    11.2621
Household slops .    89.1606

Bad as a row with Molly .    144.9470
In gay Paree he hides , Egan of Paris , unsought by any save by me .    223.0705

Somewhere in the east : early morning : set off at dawn .    101.1832
Look clock .    184.2431
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call , then paused awhile in rapt attention , his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points .    216.0005
Yes , Mr Deasy said .    5.9352
A barren land , bare waste .    162.4951
I shall die !    1065.9548
I just wanted to say , he said .    42.1850
Stephen turned away .    55.6305

Skin breeds lice or vermin .    300.5973
Poor papa !    37.5212
Too hot to quarrel .    248.7034
No , no , Buck Mulligan shouted in pain .    54.8695
Monkwords , marybeads jabber on their girdles : roguewords , tough nuggets patter in their pockets .    108.9508
You told the Clongowes gentry you had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army .    145.5493
Silence , all .    71.3046
The sum was done .    128.5406
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush , faded , the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles : world without end .    162.2223

Noon slumbers .    51.2347
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up , saying tritely : Redheaded women buck like goats .    116.4402
He turned to Stephen , saying , as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat : You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints , Kinch , could you ?    66.2611
Lulls all pain .    65.4369
As he and others see me .    160.3015
No .    5.4530

Listen .    2.3416
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him .    175.7267
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy .    135.6294
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour , bids her rise .    209.4279
Stephen asked , opening another book .    58.5172
Patrice , home on furlough , lapped warm milk with me in the bar MacMahon .    135.6827
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles , breathing upward sewage breath , a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man ’ s ashes .    153.6012
Good fallback .    138.8234

he cried thickly .    82.4492
Personally I couldn ’ t stomach that idea of a personal God .    46.8444
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster , her sails brailed up on the crosstrees , homing , upstream , silently moving , a silent ship .    102.0791
Mrs Ellis ’ s .    37.3512
Clean to see : the gloss of her sleek hide , the white button under the butt of her tail , the green flashing eyes .    76.2488
What does she say ?    71.6176
A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace ( descende !    224.5394

Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips , entranced , listening .    96.9238
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary .    164.1254
Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this .    231.8429
Mrs Bandmann Palmer .    133.4011
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires .    208.0217
Haroun al Raschid .    209.2901
Aleph , alpha : nought , nought , one .    82.2831
Did Roberts pay you yet ?    312.9353
Perhaps I am wrong .    53.5933
Full gluey woman ’ s lips .    33.9704
Secrets , silent , stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts : secrets weary of their tyranny : tyrants , willing to be dethroned .    101.4185
That was the rule , said .    50.5298
Son of the wild goose , Kevin Egan of Paris .    80.5692
No - one saw : tell no - one .    86.5530
The aunt thinks you killed your mother , he said .    32.3426
And , spent , its speech ceases .    133.7195
He has the key .    127.7042
Il croit ?    294.9459
Poor man !    49.3503
Sir Lout ’ s toys .    46.1343
As I am .    44.2873
My mother ’ s a jew , my father ’ s a bird .    18.4738
Can ’ t see !    41.3552
He smiled , glancing askance at her mocking eyes .    69.4967
I ’ m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up .    113.0987
Farmhouse , wall round it , blurred cattle cropping .    109.6604
But , I say , Mulligan , you do make strong tea , don ’ t you ?    61.7904
The hens in the next garden : their droppings are very good top dressing .    209.4901
Known as Koch ’ s preparation .    47.9187
Sociable .    2.9609
Where ?    21.0831
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone .    15.2318
Not annoyed then ?    228.0580
Better ask Seymour that .    131.7817
Hello .    1.8775
The mockery of it !    50.8901
Moist pith of farls of bread , the froggreen wormwood , her matin incense , court the air .    81.1360
History , Stephen said , is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake .    67.5269
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente , not doing a hand ’ s turn all day .    147.8228
O how I long to meet you .    111.1640
he asked .    3.7211
No , nothing has happened .    136.3620
Girl ’ s sweet light lips .    42.5309
It must be a movement then , an actuality of the possible as possible .    77.4056
So much the better .    67.3477
Have you the key ?    55.6269
Stephen freed his arm quietly .    90.4812
Yes , sir .    4.2381
He halted .    45.3685
off it and put it neatly into her mouth .    37.9393
O , do , sir .    12.8963
Or a lilt .    81.3177
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right .    60.1875
Look at that now , she said .    20.2551
Bless us , O Lord , and these thy gifts .    244.2686
Citrons too .    21.1846
Then , gazing over the handkerchief , he said : The bard ’ s noserag !    62.7351
What Paddy ?    299.0679
Je ne crois pas en l ’ existence de Dieu .    241.1184
Mulligan , nine pounds , three pairs of socks , one pair brogues , ties .    167.0738
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha .    194.2902
Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt from their pintpots , loudlatinlaughing : Euge !    194.0501
Time enough .    31.3066
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes .    160.6461
But I will fight for the right till the end .    78.2795
Lovely spot it must be : the garden of the world , big lazy leaves to float about on , cactuses , flowery meads , snaky lianas they call them .    118.9613
Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately ?    154.1013
To no end gathered ; vainly then released , forthflowing , wending back : loom of the moon .    245.6654
Put down three and carry five .    294.1908
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock , carefully .    108.2282
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf ’ s gallop .    126.7397
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions ?    394.9050
Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee .    114.9588
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen ’ s memory the triumph of their brazen bells : et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam : the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts , a chemistry of stars .    155.1485
Yes , bread of angels it ’ s called .    74.8148
Open your eyes now .    101.4837
Thanks , old chap , he cried briskly .    43.9795
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa .    397.3403
Go further next time .    199.4471
She tendered a coin , smiling boldly , holding her thick wrist out .    163.6700
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon : Heva , naked Eve .    153.3162
Yes , Mr Bloom said .    6.4044
Can ’ t he hear the difference ?    104.2817
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel .    187.4306
Who ’ s behind me ?    49.5185
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope , ripping it open in jerks .    68.9393
Young student .    49.0624
No great hurry .    179.7615
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript .    179.7979
It does .    82.1474
he said gaily .    55.9956
Comment ?    37.5361
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically .    225.1737
They were about him here and there , with heads still bowed in their crimson halters , waiting for it to melt in their stomachs .    182.8728
Sees me looking .    125.8128
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head , coach after coach .    165.4970
That doctrine of laissez faire which so often in our history .    160.1175
I want puce gloves and green boots .    132.0572
To hell with them all .    115.2490
My missus has just got an .    260.0020
Or leave it there all day , forgotten friendship ?    237.1336
Music hall stage .    263.5898
What perfume does your wife use .    222.1415
In all the highest places : her finance , her press .    93.8066
Still they get their feed all right and their doss .    115.4515
O , rocks !    81.8750
Tiptop , thanks .    22.8463
Hokypoky penny a lump .    185.9055
Makes you feel young .    72.5715
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat .    261.3082
Threepence , please .    19.1302
Ffoo !    17.1647
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man ’ s voice cried sternly : What is the matter ?    119.0236
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine .    341.5970
O , Milly Bloom , you are my darling .    58.7663
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation ’ s vital strength .    83.9422
The King ’ s own .    75.4292
Mark my words , Mr Dedalus , he said .    28.4512
And skeweyed Walter sirring his father , no less !    515.2004
The twining stresses , two by two .    227.6495
He stared at them proudly , piled stone mammoth skulls .    312.3423
You could have knelt down , damn it , Kinch , when your dying mother asked you , Buck Mulligan said .    88.9463
Secondleg they should be .    94.4946
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay , his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly .    167.2542
You were going to do wonders , what ?    83.3409
After all , I should think you are able to free yourself .    190.0155
Walter squints vainly for a chair .    194.0063
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs , the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman , a butcher ’ s dame , nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange .    165.8432
O , weeping God , the things I married into !    661.4777
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches .    194.0836
Language no whit worse than his .    558.9664
What about that , eh ?    86.0323
Then , a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking : rumpled , shiny sole .    198.8313
I ’ m coming , Buck Mulligan answered .    13.8807
The air feeds most .    891.9736
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man ’ s stare .    58.5059
No .    5.4530
O , O .    17.4887
Lover , for her love he prowled with colonel Richard Burke , tanist of his sept , under the walls of Clerkenwell and , crouching , saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward in the fog .    139.5874
The other one , jar on her head , was getting the supper : fruit , olives , lovely cool water out of a well , stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown .    178.2370
Shouldering their bags they trudged , the red Egyptians .    246.0375
All .    347.0759
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes .    61.4658
He has washed the upper moiety .    163.7072
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly , wholly , shadowing the bay in deeper green .    219.4091
I see little hope , Stephen said , from her or from him .    77.7411
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves .    213.0302
Dringadring !    18.3643
He stood up , gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown , saying resignedly : Mulligan is stripped of his garments .    90.5949
Buck Mulligan asked .    5.3284
Rhythm begins , you see .    78.6924
And he said : Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy !    289.6571
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin , twisted it round in his fingers and cried : A miracle !    97.5929
Moi , je suis socialiste .    107.8534
I have my stick .    26.0807
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish : the last .    196.5451
He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet , laughing to himself .    86.6678
The shiny links , packed with forcemeat , fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs ’ blood .    203.3794
I . . . With him together down . . .    74.7058
No , sir .    5.7774
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa , chap ticking them off in a book , navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees .    185.0545
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor .    73.1246
Pretending to speak broken English as you dragged your valise , porter threepence , across the slimy pier at Newhaven .    285.4190
He threw it on the road .    27.8977
You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street .    264.3573
The crooked skirt swinging , whack by whack by whack .    182.5027
Good morning , sir , Stephen said again , bowing to his bent back .    33.0628
They swarmed loud , uncouth about the temple , their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats .    330.2047
Chucked medicine and going in for the army .    110.6091
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam .    223.1590
No use canvassing him for an ad .    96.6320
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted .    165.5196
Mr Bloom , strolling towards Brunswick street , smiled .    105.6837
We ’ ll be choked , Buck Mulligan said .    16.2659
Maud Gonne ’ s letter about taking them off O ’ Connell street at night : disgrace to our Irish capital .    129.8651
About a million barrels all the same .    59.8544
To Caesar what is Caesar ’ s , to God what is God ’ s .    124.6510
Just C . P . M ’ Coy will do .    67.2426
Goes like this .    76.7130
Is it Paddy Dignam ?    168.6175
Naked nymphs : Greece : and for instance all the people that lived then .    196.0147
If anyone thinks that I amn ’ t divine He ’ ll get no free drinks when I ’ m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again .    289.0019
Simple bit of paper .    31.8077
Eleven , is it ?    36.7166
I know the voice .    97.4256
Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head .    152.5833
He stood suddenly , his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil .    140.1974
Spurned and undespairing .    57.3501
Yet here ’ s a spot .    44.3566
Give us that key , Kinch , Buck Mulligan said , to keep my chemise flat .    81.4529
Meade ’ s timberyard .    13.5574
Dying , he said again , if not dead by now .    61.2286
Why ?    36.7567
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree , for instance .    217.5768
My missus has just got an engagement .    189.7037
Doesn ’ t see me .    11.4363
A thing out in the water .    42.7592
Square it you with the boss and we ’ ll split the job , see ?    75.3243
What ’ s left us then ?    125.5717
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers , leaned upon his spear .    166.4417
Like me , like Algy , coming down to our mighty mother .    127.7956
In a moment they will laugh more loudly , aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay .    222.7612
And past Nichols ’ the undertaker .    714.2519
Influence of the climate .    37.6012
Watering cart .    75.3296
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner , nursing his hat and newspaper .    134.8475
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers .    112.4241
Buck Mulligan said .    2.2555
He ’ s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks , is he ?    181.3482
Why , sir ?    18.8592
I don ’ t mince words , do I ?    43.7481
All I can give you I give .    79.7642
Her head dancing .    109.2822
Down , sir !    15.4639
Poor old professor Goodwin .    162.3298
Haines sat down on a stone , smoking .    37.0760
Wombed in sin darkness I was too , made not begotten .    243.4955
So warm .    191.3268
Darkness is in our souls do you not think ?    131.9682
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker .    76.2125
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight ?    79.7806
Drink water scented with fennel , sherbet .    262.3861
And when I makes water I makes water .    302.7156
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch .    255.3928
Silly Milly ’ s birthday gift .    72.4971
The only true thing in life ?    242.5846
She serves me at his beck .    131.0926
Where ?    21.0831
If I fell over a cliff that beetles o ’ er his base , fell through the nebeneinander ineluctably !    255.0675
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees , hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield .    71.5448
I see you ’ re . . . O , no , Mr Bloom said .    16.0826
Why , I wonder .    32.3799
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand , a rag of wolf ’ s tongue redpanting from his jaws .    75.0668
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair .    200.5397
I ’ m coming , Stephen said , turning .    13.1954
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan ’ s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth , hiding and revealing its yellow glow .    122.6801
Six weeks off , however .    137.9086
Yes , sir .    4.2381
Just loll there : quiet dusk : let everything rip .    277.8642
A bit at a time .    49.2827
Ay !    29.7388
Ceasing , he began to shave with care .    94.9695
Not this Monsieur , I said .    34.6511
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets .    157.5251
You know , Dedalus , you have the real Oxford manner .    133.4893
Cough it up .    19.3989
He put the huge key in his inner pocket .    81.3490
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’ s face .    62.8659
Then the next one .    36.4329
He ’ s English , Buck Mulligan said , and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland .    67.3430
It ’ s about the foot and mouth disease .    70.3106
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here .    586.6835
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day .    81.6006
Well : slainte !    73.4451
I will see if I can see .    57.9315
Your postprandial , do you know that word ?    95.5630
Here .    4.1978
She raised a gloved hand to her hair .    78.9603
A merchant , Stephen said , is one who buys cheap and sells dear , jew or gentile , is he not ?    119.2149
Haines , who had been laughing guardedly , walked on beside Stephen and said : We oughtn ’ t to laugh , I suppose .    169.2711
He has nowhere to put it , you mug .    96.0751
He threw it .    48.6749
Other stocking .    55.7044
To come to the point at issue .    99.9326
Red carpet spread .    137.0021
Old style .    149.7314
But one day you must feel it .    115.4063
No , sir .    5.7774
There again : the overtone following through the air .    125.0521
Three times now .    79.3657
He held the page aslant patiently , bending his senses and his will , his soft subject gaze at rest .    175.2262
On earth as it is in heaven .    243.1047
Here , she said .    5.2517
He stooped and gathered them .    129.1012
Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again , he said , and show them to you , sir .    52.7174
A quart , Stephen said .    15.7625
The way of all our old industries .    127.6532
Very well then , I contradict myself .    211.9017
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail .    45.5074
Cocklepickers .    2.9238
He thinks you ’ re not a gentleman .    40.5151
My father gave me seeds to sow .    226.2351
You pique my curiosity , Haines said amiably .    100.0502
Pert little piece she was .    165.1437
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard , their land a pawnshop .    346.6692
I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms , who left the house of his father and left the God of his father .    91.3331
Dead : an old woman ’ s : the grey sunken cunt of the world .    68.3303
He turned over the smudged pages .    61.8843
What time ?    153.4376
Lascivious people .    240.4505
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars : priest with a scroll rolled up .    135.1873
And he said : Another victory like that and we are done for .    117.8127
He turned back quickly , coughing , laughing , his lifted arms waving to the air .    119.0579
This dogsbody to rid of vermin .    160.6416
A pier , sir , Armstrong said .    16.8657
I suppose I did say it .    86.9647
After a silence Cochrane said : What is it , sir ?    110.9803
Click does the trick .    110.9454
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by , amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss .    289.9272
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall .    185.6149
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble , fanshoals of fishes , silly shells .    145.1823
By a woman who was no better than she should be .    93.3990
No wind could lift those waves , grey metal , poisonous foggy waters .    249.9552
At Plevna that was .    130.1455
Was given milk too long .    384.0749
Pointed cuffs .    60.1183
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh .    296.4598
They followed the winding path down to the creek .    74.3908
With it an abode of bliss .    107.6521
Try it anyhow .    36.6194
he asked , turning .    24.1623
God , isn ’ t he dreadful ?    41.0350
Where are you off to ?    73.9144
God , these bloody English !    308.7571
And , faith , he filled up .    33.2328
Behind .    6.3211
Waters : bitter death : lost .    201.6452
Pleasant evenings we had then .    359.6910
Jousts , slush and uproar of battles , the frozen deathspew of the slain , a shout of spearspikes baited with men ’ s bloodied guts .    103.8310
Scutter !    17.0507
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats , the gently champing teeth .    236.7856
No ?    50.8431
The oval equine faces , Temple , Buck Mulligan , Foxy Campbell , Lanternjaws .    81.1727
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly , more , till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold , a limp lid .    209.7010
She poured again a measureful and a tilly .    142.7766
I just simply stood pale , silent , bayed about .    407.8506

And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them , chiding them , and to his dangling watchchain .    144.1065

My Latin quarter hat .    182.4265
He will ask for it .    73.7298
Loam , what is this that is ?    41.5521
O si , certo !    150.4128

The ballad of joking Jesus , Stephen answered .    37.1243
Wake this time next year .    159.5690
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair .    114.4269
All days make their end .    264.2819

He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it .    136.4507
The seas ’ ruler , he gazed southward over the bay , empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins .    110.1236
Night sky , moon , violet , colour of Molly ’ s new garters .    80.7851
Travel round in front of the sun , steal a day ’ s march on him .    63.3199

Made him feel a bit peckish .    106.8246
Two in the back bench whispered .    316.3550
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar .    139.8227
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket .    45.0446
She listens with big dark soft eyes .    204.1500
The same young eyes .    121.1531
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay : it seems history is to blame : on me and on my words , unhating .    212.8758
Bleibtreustrasse <NUMBER> , Berlin , W . <NUMBER> .    89.3804

Just there .    29.6415
Friend of the family .    31.7706
Life might be so .    88.4638
Stephen asked .    6.3939

Do you know anything about Pyrrhus ?    130.3925
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate : toothless terrors .    104.4080
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek .    139.5078
They halted , looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale .    137.2991
A cored apple , filled with brown sugar , roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening .    122.6095
They have forgotten Kevin Egan , not he them .    173.5204
He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand towards the Pigeonhouse .    84.8793
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun .    239.5249
Never read it .    28.6843
What is it now ?    20.0707
Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh ’ s library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas .    90.0143
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere ?    150.8600
Yes ?    62.9378
You fenians forget some things .    170.4785
She poured more tea into her cup , watching it flow sideways .    179.1610

In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets : choice blend , finest quality , family tea .    161.3047
Ripening now .    16.0274
What had Gretta Conroy on ?    484.7896

He sighed down his nose : they never understand .    176.4949
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and .    208.3622
On the spindle side .    43.8583

Making his day ’ s stations , the dingy printingcase , his three taverns , the Montmartre lair he sleeps short night in , rue de la Goutte - d ’ Or , damascened with flyblown faces of the gone .    163.6581
I ’ m glad I didn ’ t go into the room to look at his face .    31.5930

Haines said .    5.0298
A voice within the tower called loudly : Are you up there , Mulligan ?    224.7408
Ireland , they say , has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews .    108.2340
Hook it quick .    43.6055

Women all for caste till you touch the spot .    146.9874
Sit down or by the law Harry I ’ ll knock you down .    175.4882

Thank you : not having any .    82.5760
We ’ ll see you again , Haines said , turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish .    54.3864
She might like something tasty .    234.3645
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice .    82.7438

He drank at her bidding .    42.2238
It ’ s Stephen , sir .    15.0696

Got up wrong side of the bed .    111.2798
And Ristori in Vienna .    118.9541
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea , tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in .    127.5077
He creased out the letter at his side , reading it slowly as he chewed , sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth .    69.3685

The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter .    60.3928
Tell us a story , sir .    27.1072
Laughing again , he brought the mirror away from Stephen ’ s peering eyes .    60.7311
We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic .    182.1277

You can almost taste it , can ’ t you ?    69.1416
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce .    121.2524
Thanks , Stephen said .    3.9682
I often think of the beautiful name you have .    118.9124

Pardoned a classical allusion .    48.2931

Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet .    26.8574
It lay beneath him , a bowl of bitter waters .    115.4560
It ’ s nine days today .    43.9316
What ?    30.5742

Our swim first , Buck Mulligan said .    63.3625
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air : mouth to her moomb .    148.1919
She thought you wanted a cheese hollandais .    210.7848
Lethargy .    2.8845
Houyhnhnm , horsenostrilled .    23.6511
I blow him out about you , Buck Mulligan said , and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes .    86.2393
The boy ’ s blank face asked the blank window .    69.8120
Vico Road , Dalkey .    63.7525
Famine , plague and slaughters .    52.4757
Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade .    47.7127

A mouthful of tea .    18.8172

Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme .    248.2144
Why are their tongues so rough ?    220.2061
He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea .    122.8754
Thus spake Zarathustra .    119.4121
No .    5.4530
Why don ’ t you trust me more ?    41.6236
His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand , a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck .    126.4615
No - one .    22.7079
They do .    74.4801
I don ’ t see anything .    8.9187
Young kisses : the first .    63.4057
That reminds me , Haines said , rising , that I have to visit your national library today .    70.9619
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes .    98.5148
Cantrell and Cochrane ’ s Ginger Ale ( Aromatic ) .    123.6706
Halted , he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely : Come up , Kinch !    109.1163

I ’ m stony .    28.0073
Someone killed her , Stephen said gloomily .    99.7053
O , yes , Mr Bloom said .    9.1008
You ’ re not a believer , are you ?    43.3427
With mother ’ s money order , eight shillings , the banging door of the post office slammed in your face by the usher .    94.7615
Another time .    29.4580
One tabloid of cascara sagrada .    93.1602
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger , teadust , biscuitmush .    118.0600
In the trousers I left off .    169.5972
Wander through awned streets .    151.8874
Virginia creepers .    51.5590
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers ’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles .    70.2275
My handkerchief .    77.8538
the cat said loudly .    81.3947
Give you the needle that would .    86.7103
He died on Monday , poor fellow .    203.4629
Always the same , year after year .    67.7956
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm .    96.8211
Thursday : not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley ’ s .    88.6284
Justice .    2.8945
You were awfully holy , weren ’ t you ?    33.3242
Corpse .    2.7877
Too full for words .    62.1930
Creaky wardrobe .    55.9304
Sands and stones .    29.3915
he said quietly .    29.6194
I hear them at the piano downstairs .    63.5646
The truth , spit it out .    71.6179
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him , moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water .    78.0717
We did great biz yesterday .    188.5320
Yes , what is it ?    21.8087
Per second per second .    124.4655
Kind of stuff you read : in the track of the sun .    40.4227
Might manage a sketch .    108.2733
A phrase , then , of impatience , thud of Blake ’ s wings of excess .    87.1187
I throw this ended shadow from me , manshape ineluctable , call it back .    162.6412
A sweetened boy ’ s breath .    31.5429
We ’ ll owe twopence , he said .    17.7696
Fabled by the daughters of memory .    48.7346
How are you ?    30.6235
Kingstown pier , Stephen said .    7.6922
Stephen , an elbow rested on the jagged granite , leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve .    80.6038
The soul is in a manner all that is : the soul is the form of forms .    67.0713
O , my name for you is the best : Kinch , the knife - blade .    64.8550
But I couldn ’ t go in that light suit .    46.6452
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses .    82.6072
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech , confidently .    165.3634
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws , a lady of letters .    128.0708
Then feel all like one family party , same in the theatre , all in the same swim .    113.7587
Let me be and let me live .    228.1162
Ham and eggs , no .    60.7259
It bore the oldest , the first race .    115.7224
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last : Rather bleak in wintertime , I should say .    201.1389
They like them sizeable .    140.0500
That must be why the women go after them .    126.9587
Proudly walking .    82.3855
Funny I don ’ t remember that .    11.8056
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes .    159.7967
I was young .    116.9531
I would want to .    104.3315
Valise I have a particular fancy for .    83.8157
Well ?    29.3381
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back .    85.8889
They came down the steps from Leahy ’ s terrace prudently , Frauenzimmer : and down the shelving shore flabbily , their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand .    99.1289
he murmured to himself .    44.5807
What did you say that for ?    53.7132
Not like Ecce Homo .    179.3934
Families of them .    14.7330
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone .    257.4731
Warm sunshine merrying over the sea .    115.4194
He leaned back and went on again , having just remembered .    73.4646
Sit down a moment .    33.1663
Some say they remember their past lives .    241.6208
Then he put a forkful into his mouth , chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat .    94.3004
Haines said , beginning to point at Stephen .    59.0438
Cup of tea now .    28.5859
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth , murmuring all the time .    71.0103
Who ’ s getting it up ?    40.3905
Of lost leaders , the betrayed , wild escapes .    184.4359
Turning the curve he waved his hand .    57.1676
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads .    148.1424
They all fall to the ground .    76.8597
Their Eldorado .    48.2660
Barrels bumped in his head : dull porter slopped and churned inside .    154.4956
On the hands down .    36.9535
He passed it along the table towards the old woman , saying : Ask nothing more of me , sweet .    86.3919
Are there any letters for me ?    83.5699
Buck Mulligan , walking forward again , raised his hands .    38.7643
No : that book .    39.1405
Stephen asked .    6.3939
She curtseyed and went out , followed by Buck Mulligan ’ s tender chant : Heart of my heart , were it more , More would be laid at your feet .    96.0590
He coasted them , walking warily .    116.3844
The drone of his misleading whistle brings Walter back .    96.1630
Liliata rutilantium .    44.4151
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket .    103.8625
A flower .    45.5679
He liked thick giblet soup , nutty gizzards , a stuffed roast heart , liverslices fried with crustcrumbs , fried hencods ’ roes .    110.0319
There he is .    95.9460
A server of a servant .    18.3764
No guts in it .    53.5627
Beauty is not there .    27.7221
I feel so bad about .    168.7137
The cat went up in soft bounds .    92.2246
He says it ’ s very clever .    85.6540
Usual love scrimmage .    180.7754
Well , I am here now .    23.7691
White breast of the dim sea .    46.7606
So .    9.6875
With the Bannons .    38.4406
Why not endless till the farthest star ?    307.4792
I thirst .    42.4181
Nothing doing .    76.9787
Eyes front .    97.4963
A million pounds , wait a moment .    107.5234
I hope that smallpox up there doesn ’ t get worse .    102.3625
Now that was farseeing .    53.1407
What ’ s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet ’ s breezy . . . Goodbye , now , goodbye !    73.3879
Damn it .    16.6959
The king was in his countinghouse .    54.3156
Only five she was then .    122.3865
Heaviness : hot day coming .    86.5339
He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread , impaled on his knife .    99.9018
Your wife and my wife .    79.0345
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and , glancing at Haines and Stephen , crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone .    95.6201
Who was telling me ?    100.1880
Cheeseparing nose .    74.9413
That is Kevin Egan ’ s movement I made , nodding for his nap , sabbath sleep .    93.5353
The Ship , Buck Mulligan cried .    21.3198
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid ?    140.9287
Dogskull , dogsniff , eyes on the ground , moves to one great goal .    95.8030
Russell , one guinea , Cousins , ten shillings , Bob Reynolds , half a guinea , Koehler , three guineas , Mrs MacKernan , five weeks ’ board .    84.9331
Might be happy all the same that way .    104.4665
They take me for a dun , peer out from a coign of vantage .    75.7286
The new air greeted him , harping in wild nerves , wind of wild air of seeds of brightness .    87.1918
Let him stay , Stephen said .    21.2904
I think of you so often you have no idea .    145.6942
Would you like a bite of something ?    38.7346
The flood is following me .    90.4806
To provoke the rain .    67.0065
Not a bit funky .    46.5433
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers .    150.6591
Of course I ’ m a Britisher , Haines ’ s voice said , and I feel as one .    34.9866
No , she can jump me .    60.0466
<NUMBER> B . C . Asculum , Stephen said , glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book .    44.4772
Spoils slung at her back .    40.2849
By the way no harm .    73.1067
I ’ d go if I possibly could .    83.7174
Softsoaping .    2.8476
Stephen rustled the sheets again .    50.4612
Buss her , wap in rogues ’ rum lingo , for , O , my dimber wapping dell !    111.5481
A kind of a bridge .    29.3505
Hothouse in Botanic gardens .    59.7989
Get down , baldpoll !    106.9706
Done to a turn .    39.6409
I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman .    171.8482
I ’ m the bermensch .    16.7757
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children ’ s shirts .    51.9794
Gone .    3.2045
A shout in the street , Stephen answered , shrugging his shoulders .    30.4027
Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea .    96.5347
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand , trotting , sniffing on all sides .    70.5153
What are you singing ?    71.4653
There is no time to lose .    57.6591
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn ’ t live .    78.7215
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head .    74.2401
From whom ?    91.5473
We ’ re always tired in the morning , Stephen said to Haines .    24.1640
It ’ s a law something like that .    22.9188
Coloured on a flat : yes , that ’ s right .    26.4397
M . Fifteen yesterday .    127.3494
Then what is it ?    32.8802
The cat , having cleaned all her fur , returned to the meatstained paper , nosed at it and stalked to the door .    68.5928
Just how she stalks over my writingtable .    161.2225
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone , in shirtsleeves , his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder .    48.4450
Gaze in your omphalos .    39.7004
Some people believe , he said , that we go on living in another body after death , that we lived before .    126.8503
Poor Dignam !    115.6660
Irish Homestead .    59.8903
Papa ’ s little bedpal .    19.1566
Says he found a sweet young thing down there .    116.9379
The froeken , bonne tout faire , who rubs male nakedness in the bath at Upsala .    131.6867
Go on then , Talbot .    40.8244
Pyrrhus , sir ?    11.7759
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and , bending in loose laughter , said to Stephen ’ s ear : O , shade of Kinch the elder !    72.3691
Talk : as if that would mend matters .    208.9274
He walked along the upwardcurving path .    78.1237
Four shining sovereigns , Buck Mulligan cried with delight .    53.9012
Just one moment .    29.0474
Soft day , sir John !    89.9449
Hello , M ’ Coy .    13.1046
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland .    83.6365
Like to see her again in that .    49.5085
More tell me , more still !    233.6512
Would I make any money by it ?    123.7234
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday .    264.9311
Haines stood at the doorway , looking out .    31.5443
That is why mystic monks .    129.0953
Mrs Marion .    21.5381
His arm .    28.5538
Have you read his F ?    138.2082
Buck Mulligan said .    2.2555
Number eighty still unlet .    244.0444
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare ’ s ghost is Hamlet ’ s grandfather .    41.2329
You ’ ll look spiffing in them .    33.7147
Our prize titbit : Matcham ’ s Masterstroke .    56.4640
Must get those settled really .    90.6134
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her .    63.3020
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word ?    84.4718
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow .    96.7690
Haines sat down to pour out the tea .    46.3773
Womb of sin .    14.7619
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows .    86.3802
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem .    95.3298
Watch !    12.1339
No black clouds anywhere , are there ?    135.5249
Say he got ten per cent off .    272.8449
One of the best , M ’ Coy said .    34.7910
Hooray !    16.6031
O ’ Brien .    29.6770
They ’ re taught that .    28.9119
McCann , one guinea .    25.8134
To learn one must be humble .    154.0255
she cried , running to lap .    62.2278
With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table , with trousers down at heels , chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor ’ s shears .    69.2499
Thanks : new tam : Mr Coghlan : lough Owel picnic : young student : Blazes Boylan ’ s seaside girls .    75.6239
The cracked lookingglass of a servant .    26.2161
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak .    98.0876
Her slim legs running up the staircase .    84.4156
Ah , poor dogsbody !    31.8839
God !    19.8320
And a letter for you .    37.4919
You had better get your stick and go out to the others , Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form .    55.7549
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes , rearing horses , rocks .    99.3396
Agendath Netaim : planters ’ company .    77.7686
Weary too in sight of lovers , lascivious men , a naked woman shining in her courts , she draws a toil of waters .    80.3439
At one , he said .    11.5060
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade .    30.5136
Costive .    2.8911
What is your idea of Hamlet ?    64.3652
Arbutus place : Pleasants street : pleasant old times .    175.5589
There ’ s only one sense of the word , it seems to me , Stephen said .    25.9640
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs , nebeneinander .    62.4366
Sleeping sickness in the air .    35.8479
Leaving the door ajar , amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces .    87.5434
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth .    84.1742
Cyril Sargent : his name and seal .    106.1681
It ’ s all right .    6.9977
The figures whitened in his mind , unsolved : displeased , he let them fade .    102.7285
Then he put on his hat again , relieved : and read again : choice blend , made of the finest Ceylon brands .    71.5504
Hair ?    51.6489
Shut your eyes and see .    71.6193
I hear .    52.7660
Who is my neighbour ?    47.0748
He faced about and back again .    105.6372
It suits me splendid .    246.5803
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone , scarcely having been .    171.9505
All human history moves towards one great goal , the manifestation of God .    134.7811

Signs on a white field .    51.8470
Mr Deasy is calling you .    72.1823
But what does Shakespeare say ?    142.6511
Yes , Mr Bloom said .    6.4044
Old hag with the yellow teeth .    93.3419
Haines , come in .    115.8659
The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror , he said .    42.5898
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality .    86.2165
Twopence a pint , fourpence a quart , eightpence a gallon of porter , no , one and fourpence a gallon of porter .    42.9208
Table : able .    27.8482
His head disappeared and reappeared .    63.6720
The Evening Telegraph . . . That will do , Mr Deasy said .    28.9981
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him .    44.2283
Buck Mulligan ’ s face smiled with delight .    36.7771
Damn all else they are good for .    120.5537
Chewer of corpses !    49.0904
she said .    3.9747
Time enough , sir , she said , taking the coin .    22.5533
Fifteen multiplied by .    751.2253
Queer I was just thinking that moment .    70.3184
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord , hushed in ruddy wool .    89.5417
No , the dog .    34.5536
Then he went to the dresser , took the jug Hanlon ’ s milkman had just filled for him , poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor .    58.3803
Pier with lamps , summer evening , band .    75.6387
My twelfth rib is gone , he cried .    74.7084
Most licentious custom .    108.1890
Then think of the competition .    42.3240
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight , putting back his savingsbox .    94.3983
Keen glance you gave her .    193.3208
You might put down my name at the funeral , will you ?    61.6055
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings , darned with lumpy wool .    202.4306
Why did you enclose the stamps ?    96.8304
Sleep six months out of twelve .    110.4932
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker .    36.9688
Where is my hat , by the way ?    59.8772
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up , roll over to the sun a puffy face , saltwhite .    120.9890
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can ’ t mouse after .    95.0650
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks , cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket , his hat tilted down on his eyes .    80.9868
Wife is oldish .    41.1434
They will walk on it tonight , coming here in the dark .    70.6284
He carried it upstairs , his thumb hooked in the teapot handle .    96.3210
Then , lo and behold , they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons .    170.7669
Plasters on a sore eye .    33.6667
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly , an elbow on the pillow .    110.6523
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand .    28.9301
Reading , lying back now , counting the strands of her hair , smiling , braiding .    54.5541
Speaking to me .    17.2344
She asked you who was in your room .    68.0294
Cigar has a cooling effect .    70.7778
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly , showing an open copybook .    142.4096
Hello , Bloom .    29.0956
No good eggs with this drouth .    120.7237
Listen .    2.3416
To evening lands .    127.0741
What is that , a bob here and there , dribs and drabs .    63.8958
Who ever anywhere will read these written words ?    574.8301
And Mr ?    682.6055
It ’ s in the lock , Stephen said , coming forward .    22.4213
It sat there , dull and squat , its spout stuck out .    84.2192
Yes , my love ?    51.7865
Or was that only possible which came to pass ?    237.6915
No , they will pass on , passing , chafing against the low rocks , swirling , passing .    84.5540
Call away let him : thy quarrons dainty is .    204.8066
Talbot asked simply , bending forward .    148.6075
See now .    16.0708
I got mummy ’ s lovely box of creams and am writing .    86.1415
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were ?    281.7842
Stephen said .    3.8290
A hard one , sir .    26.7382
Morning mouth bad images .    153.3400
Then come out a bit spreeish .    70.3632
It ’ s not fair to tease you like that , Kinch , is it ?    37.2582
It is very simple , Stephen said as he stood up .    34.2063
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter .    37.8988
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues .    48.8009
Poor papa !    37.5212
Nothing she can eat ?    121.7209
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke .    197.1076
The words troubled their gaze .    368.2054
Everything on it ?    35.3088
he asked .    3.7211
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack .    57.1850
Sir .    5.2603
They are waiting for him now .    62.9245
Now I ’ m going to try publicity .    27.3478
Inishboffin .    2.9050
Excuse bad writing .    51.5337
An example ?    270.2935
He saw their speeds , backing king ’ s colours , and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds .    59.3428
Save it they can ’ t .    36.3388
Give up the moody brooding .    54.1270
Not a word more on that subject !    207.7047
Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou .    130.9930
No use thinking of it any more .    99.3570
Didn ’ t catch me napping that wheeze .    69.4420
I said .    51.0228
Stephen , shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart , said very coldly : I am not thinking of the offence to my mother .    70.6397
Nom de Dieu !    46.2471
All the way from Gibraltar .    75.4926
In a suddenly changed tone he added : To tell you the God ’ s truth I think you ’ re right .    71.0247
Il est irlandais .    52.7670
Hard as nails at a bargain , old Tweedy .    56.4502
His arm : Cranly ’ s arm .    36.3401
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney .    102.8834
Perhaps he was a woman .    59.4816
Her hat sank at once .    72.6536
One moment .    27.8244
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him .    116.3548
That will do , Mr Deasy said briskly .    33.8451
With envy he watched their faces : Edith , Ethel , Gerty , Lily .    104.4738
Stephen asked her .    29.2872
Buck Mulligan said .    2.2555
He walked on , waiting to be spoken to , trailing his ashplant by his side .    62.8694
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect : Is there any . . . no trouble I hope ?    80.3332
I have a letter here for the press .    26.4622
What they called nymphs , for example .    215.1605
Who knows ?    85.9951
Soft mark .    38.5116
Where is she ?    23.2813
Japhet in search of a father !    58.1134
He shook his constraint from him nervously .    73.3035
I remember .    33.2141
Yes .    2.0277
You wouldn ’ t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you .    54.8038
Far away now past .    220.4985
The aunt thinks you killed your mother .    62.1577
Living in a bogswamp , eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust , horsedung and consumptives ’ spits .    88.2426

Vain : very .    230.6881
Stamps : stickyback pictures .    49.9742
Drago ’ s shopbell ringing .    20.2406
She gazed straight before her , inhaling through her arched nostrils .    143.9282
To the secretary of state for war , Stephen added over his shoulder .    62.5692
He ’ s stinking with money and thinks you ’ re not a gentleman .    56.7591
Cleanchested .    2.8692
Rum idea : eating bits of a corpse .    86.8086
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim , rinsing empties and old man in the cellar .    100.2209
O let him !    580.4094
Bold hand .    18.3712
I get paid this morning , Stephen said .    35.3668
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen .    69.4445
He halted before Dlugacz ’ s window , staring at the hanks of sausages , polonies , black and white .    63.8005
And to think of your having to beg from these swine .    183.0081
You have two copies there .    70.1530
It wouldn ’ t pan out somehow .    45.2075
Bath a most private thing .    67.9188
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry : Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one , and Arius , warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father , and Valentine , spurning Christ ’ s terrene body , and    82.1309
the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son .    257.7806
Ringsend : wigwams of brown steersmen and master mariners .    73.7100
I paid the rent .    54.3683
You , Cochrane , what city sent for him ?    196.8791
Ruins and tenements .    53.8459
He scrambled up by the stones , water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair , water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth .    79.4025
The coals were reddening .    167.3299
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine .    137.7527
I forget the place , sir .    30.8798
Did I not take it up ?    77.9964
My wife too , he said .    16.9649
Ferm .    2.9241
Chopsticks ?    35.7212
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him .    89.8379
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high .    64.4679
Looked shut .    42.5042
Why Ophelia committed suicide .    448.6367
Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him , cleft by a crooked crack .    64.1604
What then ?    217.9170
Airs romped round him , nipping and eager airs .    76.2919
Yes , she said .    4.5823
The ghostcandle to light her agony .    121.0943
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O ’ Loughlin ’ s of Blackpitts .    115.0798

Print anything now .    62.2412
He smiled , pleasing himself .    52.1593
Mulligan said .    6.4072
Stephen , taking his ashplant from its leaningplace , followed them out and , as they went down the ladder , pulled to the slow iron door and locked it .    69.4092
For whom ?    101.8206
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur ’ s yelping .    72.6709
They are coming , waves .    58.7103
No more letters , I hope .    101.0493
He can ’ t make you out .    56.3284
I ’ ll do that , Mr Bloom said , moving to get off .    27.3628
From the liberties , out for the day .    38.9259
Electric .    2.9532
He frowned sternly on the bright air .    63.5666
Go easy .    52.8443
I see you .    28.0623
His back is like that Norwegian captain ’ s .    104.8349

There is a meeting of the cattletraders ’ association today at the City Arms hotel .    57.3990
It ’ s a wonderful tale , Haines said , bringing them to halt again .    32.4939
No .    5.4530
No , I didn ’ t .    12.4695
I am caught in this burning scene .    104.4138
For you , please ?    54.9863
He felt heavy , full : then a gentle loosening of his bowels .    92.7431

He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail .    109.3301
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed .    90.8528
