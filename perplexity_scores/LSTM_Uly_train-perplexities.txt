<BOS> You had better get your stick and go out to the others , Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’ s graceless form .    47.8911
<BOS> Careless air : just drop in to see .    70.7079
<BOS> You were awfully holy , weren ’ t you ?    29.7633
<BOS> He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees , hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield .    46.9714
<BOS> Can you do them yourself ?    56.8458
<BOS> Cough it up .    26.0787
<BOS> Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster , her sails brailed up on the crosstrees , homing , upstream , silently moving , a silent ship .    73.3733
<BOS> I didn ’ t see the paper .    11.5186

<BOS> Stephen filled a third cup , a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk .    89.5350
<BOS> To keep it up .    27.1540
<BOS> he asked .    11.7092

<BOS> It does .    37.0504
<BOS> I have a letter here for the press .    21.9137
<BOS> He threw it on the road .    16.3461
<BOS> Too hot to quarrel .    89.7834
<BOS> With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands .    117.7316
<BOS> Martha , Mary .    33.3979
<BOS> Why is that , I wonder , or does it mean something perhaps ?    75.4736
<BOS> The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat : veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field .    96.4688
<BOS> Sit down or by the law Harry I ’ ll knock you down .    74.0310
<BOS> The hens in the next garden : their droppings are very good top dressing .    122.2130

<BOS> Thanks , old man .    19.7297

<BOS> Her head dancing .    42.2138
<BOS> If he stays on here I am off .    95.5875
<BOS> There he is .    38.6881
<BOS> He held the page aslant patiently , bending his senses and his will , his soft subject gaze at rest .    102.3743
<BOS> Let us get out of the kip .    36.1165
<BOS> When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes .    64.5044
<BOS> He moved a little to the side of M ’ Coy ’ s talking head .    49.9792
<BOS> Now that was farseeing .    45.2491
<BOS> Malt for Richie and Stephen , tell mother .    102.9898
<BOS> A merchant , Stephen said , is one who buys cheap and sells dear , jew or gentile , is he not ?    66.7896
<BOS> Turn over , Stephen said quietly .    38.0294
<BOS> How are you ?    23.1724

<BOS> Makes you feel young .    59.1984
<BOS> Curse your noisy pugnose .    65.4463
<BOS> Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker .    42.8782
<BOS> Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam ’ s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death .    151.4424
<BOS> To provoke the rain .    42.2225
<BOS> He frowned sternly on the bright air .    40.1093
<BOS> Here , I am not walking out to the Kish lightship , am I ?    52.1054
<BOS> Better find out in the paper .    29.2605
<BOS> Turning , he scanned the shore south , his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets .    82.7872
<BOS> Someone killed her , Stephen said gloomily .    53.6772
<BOS> Not this Monsieur , I said .    22.7405
<BOS> The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes .    95.9027
<BOS> There ’ s five fathoms out there , he said .    22.2634
<BOS> I see you .    12.1435
<BOS> She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt .    113.0081
<BOS> She might like something tasty .    95.7833
<BOS> Kind of stuff you read : in the track of the sun .    45.1219
<BOS> They swarmed loud , uncouth about the temple , their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats .    128.5208
<BOS> Lump of love .    42.6773
<BOS> Bold hand .    27.8749
<BOS> The cold smell of sacred stone called him .    88.7222
<BOS> Then the next one : a small old woman .    39.4333
<BOS> Is she up the pole ?    56.7909
<BOS> Fifteen multiplied by .    148.7046
<BOS> Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot .    111.8123
<BOS> I don ’ t mince words , do I ?    23.0240

<BOS> He stared at them proudly , piled stone mammoth skulls .    102.8920
<BOS> Excuse bad writing .    75.1093
<BOS> Metempsychosis ?    39.4424

<BOS> Best of all though are the cattle , especially when they are fed on those oilcakes .    103.2003
<BOS> Was given milk too long .    183.9067
<BOS> He stood up , gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown , saying resignedly : Mulligan is stripped of his garments .    53.9623
<BOS> Whusky !    35.7799
<BOS> All right till I come back anyhow .    155.8182
<BOS> Buck Mulligan brought up a florin , twisted it round in his fingers and cried : A miracle !    48.0534
<BOS> While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair .    99.4455
<BOS> I ’ ll show you my likeness one day .    45.0740
<BOS> He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay , his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly .    87.9254

<BOS> Stately , plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead , bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed .    66.0781
<BOS> You might put down my name at the funeral , will you ?    52.8173
<BOS> All .    38.6495
<BOS> The soul is in a manner all that is : the soul is the form of forms .    53.3186
<BOS> Did I not take it up ?    50.3276
<BOS> His hand turned the page over .    52.8294

<BOS> A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting .    168.8539
<BOS> She lapped slower , then licking the saucer clean .    105.2885
<BOS> How much ?    46.4402

<BOS> I mustn ’ t forget his letter for the press .    30.6925

<BOS> Stephen listened in scornful silence .    78.3098
<BOS> And twopence , he said , for a pint .    18.1449
<BOS> Still , she might do worse .    68.9963
<BOS> They sinned against the light , Mr Deasy said gravely .    44.4147
<BOS> Stephen Dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck .    67.6561
<BOS> As I am .    21.3853

<BOS> My twelfth rib is gone , he cried .    53.6155
<BOS> Hunger toothache .    69.4086
<BOS> I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in .    87.9643
<BOS> Good day to you .    32.4692
<BOS> The dog yelped running to them , reared up and pawed them , dropping on all fours , again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning .    95.8011
<BOS> Haines , come in .    67.3488
<BOS> Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer ’ s heart and lips and on mine .    119.7056
<BOS> He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock , resting his ashplant in a grike .    48.5839
<BOS> Then here ’ s a health to Mulligan ’ s aunt And I ’ ll tell you the reason why .    48.8018
<BOS> Drago ’ s shopbell ringing .    30.2569
<BOS> Then he girded up his trousers , braced and buttoned himself .    40.9492
<BOS> O let him !    99.2731
<BOS> A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him , moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water .    64.2073
<BOS> The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath .    69.5197
<BOS> He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up , saying tritely : Redheaded women buck like goats .    87.7063
<BOS> He liked to read at stool .    41.7965

<BOS> Then I will tell you all .    45.9307
<BOS> he asked .    11.7092
<BOS> He turned to Stephen and said : Seriously , Dedalus .    32.7523
<BOS> Yes , my love ?    28.0698
<BOS> He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea , tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in .    90.3085
<BOS> She serves me at his beck .    62.4869
<BOS> He coasted them , walking warily .    67.6906
<BOS> You fenians forget some things .    100.1701
<BOS> It is very simple , Stephen said as he stood up .    33.8990
<BOS> Secrets , silent , stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts : secrets weary of their tyranny : tyrants , willing to be dethroned .    78.8585
<BOS> He smiled , glancing askance at her mocking eyes .    42.7879
<BOS> Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues .    71.6911
<BOS> Nothing doing .    56.5490
<BOS> Forget : a dispossessed .    40.2242
<BOS> While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him .    129.3628
<BOS> Why is that ?    12.3720
<BOS> He turned to Stephen , saying , as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat : You couldn ’ t manage it under three pints , Kinch , could you ?    58.9510
<BOS> I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman .    80.3958
<BOS> Tell me now , Stephen said , poking the boy ’ s shoulder with the book , what is a pier .    29.8739
